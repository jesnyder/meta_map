See Exclusion Criterion #6.\n\nSubjects who received COVID-19 vaccination are eligible for the study if it is more than 28 days since the last dose of vaccination. COVID-19 vaccination is not necessary for inclusion.\n\nAll subjects will need be on < 5 L O2/min to be included or on no oxygen to be enrolled in this study.\n\nIf the candidate is either male or female of reproductive potential, he or she must agree to use of double barrier method of highly effective birth control contraception such as condoms with oral contraceptive pill or choose to remain abstinent if already practicing abstinence during the screening period. The duration of required usage of double barrier method OR maintenance of abstinence must include the time from the beginning of the screening period until 90 days following the last dose of the study treatment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nExclusion from study enrollment includes meeting one or more of the following criteria:\n\nVulnerable populations such as pregnant patients, children, individuals with severe physical or mental disabilities who cannot provide meaningful consent.\n\nSpO2 < 94% on ambient air.\n\nActive malignancy requiring treatment within the last five years.\n\nMajor surgery or physical trauma in the last 3 months, including motor vehicle accidents, assaults, mechanical falls with sequelae of significant bleeding or craniofacial bruising, and surgeries.\n\nAll subjects with any comorbidities that may be associated with risk of progression to severe COVID-19 including but not limited to renal dysfunction, hepatic disease, substance abuse, fibromyalgia, heart failure, uncontrolled arrhythmias, any level of dementia, depression, connective tissue diseases, major neuromuscular deficits, and endocrine disorders.\n\nSubjects found to be at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19 will be excluded from the study. These subjects will be referred to outpatient internal medicine clinic for SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody treatment. As defined by the CDC and NIH, high risk for progression to severe COVID-19 is defined by meeting at least one of the following criteria:\n\nBody mass index (BMI) >35\n\nHave chronic kidney disease\n\nHave diabetes\n\nHave immunosuppressive disease\n\nAre currently receiving immunosuppressive treatment\n\nAre >65 years of age\n\nAre >55 years of age AND have\n\nCardiovascular disease, OR\n\nHypertension, OR\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease/other chronic respiratory disease.\n\nPatients who received SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody treatment will be excluded from the study.\n\nVital sign abnormalities: temperature â‰¥ 38 Â°C, temperature < 35 Â°C; systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90 mmHg, SBP â‰¥ 170 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 50 mmHg, DBP â‰¥ 100 mmHg; heart rate (HR) < 50 beats per minute (BPM), HR â‰¥ 120 BPM.\n\nLab abnormalities: WBC â‰¥ 12,000 /Î¼L, Creatinine â‰¥ 1.5 mg/dL, AST â‰¥ 100 IU/l, and/or ALT â‰¥ 100 IU/I\n\nPatients who received COVID-19 vaccination within last 28 days.",
