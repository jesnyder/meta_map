      "BriefSummary": "This is a modular, first time in patient, open-label, multicentre study of OMO-1, administered orally, alone and in combination with anti-cancer treatments, in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic solid malignancies.",
      "DetailedDescription": "The study will consist of a number of study modules. The initial Module 1 will evaluate OMO-1 as monotherapy to provide dose(s) and schedule(s) for further Modules of combination therapy.\n\nModule 2 will evaluate OMO-1 in combination with small molecule EGFR-TKIs.\n\nStudy modules will consist of a Part A (dose finding) and an optional Part B (cohort expansion). The option to start Part B and add further modules will be the decision of the safety review committee, based on emerging preclinical anti-tumour data and, safety and tolerability information from the study as a whole.\n\nFor all modules, Part A cohorts may be expanded by up to 12 additional patients at doses (at or above the MBAD) that have been confirmed to be tolerated. These patients will have mandatory paired biopsies to assess the tumour for relevant PDc biomarkers, and to explore further the tolerability, safety and PK activity at these doses.\n\nIn all combination modules, the dose of each combination agent investigated will not exceed their current recommended dose. The starting dose of OMO-1 in combination modules will not exceed the one currently tolerated in Module 1 (monotherapy). For cohorts in which OMO-1 is dosed in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, dosing will not continue once the cycles of chemotherapy have been completed."
