      "BriefSummary": "This study consists of two phases (Phase I and Phase IIa). Phase IIa will be conducted sequentially after the safety of SCM-AGH is secured in Phase I.\n\nPhase I: Multicenter in Korea, Non-Randomized, Open-label, Single Arm, 3+3 design) for Severe Acute Pancreatitis\nPhase II: Multicenter in Korea, Randomized, Double-blind, 2-arm, Placebo-controlled, Parallel arm for Moderate to Severe Acute Pancreatitis",
      "DetailedDescription": "Phase I (Multicenter in Korea, Non-Randomized, Open-label, Single Arm, 3+3 design): Three and up to six patients with severe Acute Pancreatitis are planned to recruit from 12 sites in Korea, but additional three patients can be enrolled by an assessment of Adverse Drug Reaction(ADR) from first three subjects .\n\nSubjects will be administered with SCM-AGH as an intravenous (IV) infusion once a day for 3 days. Efficacy and safety are assessed daily for the first week, and then weekly on 3 occasions (Day 14, 21, and 28). Survival is followed up until Day 90.\n\nPhase II (Multicenter in Korea, Randomized, Double-blind, 2-arm, Placebo-controlled, Parallel arm): Eligible patients will be randomized to the SCM-AGH group or placebo group at 1:1 ratio. Total 36 patients with Moderate to Severe Acute Pancreatitis are planned to be enrolled from 12 sites in Korea. Subjects will receive SCM-AGH on Day 0, 1, and 2. Existing standard of care is permitted. Efficacy and safety are assessed daily for the first week, and then weekly on 3 occasions (Day 14, 21, and 28). Survival is followed up until Day 90."
