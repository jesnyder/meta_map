      "DetailedDescription": "AD-SVF will be collected from the patient's adipose-derived tissue (body fat). Using local anesthesia, Liposuction will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen. The adipose tissue is then transferred to the laboratory for separation of AD-SVF. In addition, patient's peripheral blood will be collected for isolation of platelet rich plasma (PRP), which are then combined with the AD-SVF for intra-articular administration of affected joint."
