      "BriefSummary": "Ocular chemical burn is one of the cause of vision loss in our country, and there are no satisfactory treatment. Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have the biological characteristics of self-renewal, immune regulation, multidirectional differentiation and tissue repair. Our preliminary research showed that in corneal alkali injury rats, the MSC can accelerated the cornea repair, inhibited angiogenesis. The aim of this study is to access the efficacy and safety of mesenchymal stem cell in the treatment of corneal burn in human.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Corneal burn is a ocular damage disease included chemically burned and thermally burned. Surgery of corneal transplantation，amniotic membrane transplantation are some of effective,however,these therapy are expensive and the transplantation resources are limited. To arrest the inflammatory phase, several types of immunosuppressive treatments have been investigated. Corticosteroids also is important, however, long time usage of corticosteroids often cause severe side-effects. Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have the biological characteristics of self -renewal, immune regulation, multidirectional differentiation and tissue repair. Our preliminary research showed that in corneal alkali injury rats, the MSC can accelerated the cornea repair, inhibited angiogenesis. Many animal research also revealed that MSC have effect on the ocular alkali burned. And subconjunctivity injection is efficient, the clinical study of MSC on treating other disease have been developed rapidly recently, in further ,the outcome are encouraging, and no side-effect related MSC was reported, MSC can come from bone marrow, Umbilical cord blood，Adipose tissue and so on, but bone marrow MSC is mostly common used. The investigators propose to assess the efficacy and safety of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell in the treatment of corneal burn in human."
