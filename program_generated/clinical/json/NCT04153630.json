      "DetailedDescription": "The Main Objective is to evaluate the safety and therapeutic efficacy of haploidentical MSCs derived from bone marrow administered by intravenous injection for the treatment of patients with RDBS. The assessment of the symptomatic improvement of the treated patients will be made regarding the baseline situation and the response to treatment at the biochemical, histological and molecular level.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nDescribe the clinical and molecular phenotype of the mucocutaneous involvement of patients, including the characterization of the mutations responsible for the disease.\n\nStudy drug: Allogenic mesenchymal cells (haploidentical) derived from bone marrow and expanded.\n\nMethod of administration: Systemic / Intravenous Administration dose: 2-3x10e6 BM-MSC / Kg. Weekly dose for three consecutive weeks\n\nFollow-up period: 12 months after the infusion. However, patients will be monitored outside the clinical trial over a 5-year period"
