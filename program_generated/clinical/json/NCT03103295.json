      "BriefSummary": "This study investigates safety and efficacy of traumatic bone defects treatment with use of 3D tissue engineered bone equivalent (3D-TEBE).\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate 3D-TEBE transplantation as a safe and efficient treatment for patients with traumatic long bone defects of critical size.",
      "DetailedDescription": "This new method of critical sized long bone defects treatment is under clinical development. Treatment of critical sized bone defects is an actual clinical challenge. The \"gold standard\" in this case is autologous bone grafting. The method disadvantage is associated with limited donor bone resources. Based on our preliminary clinical trial positive results on use of autologous cultured bone marrow-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) in traumatology, our aim was to develop 3D tissue-engineered bone equivalent transplantation technology for restoration of critical sized bone defects. The proposed 3D-TEBE transplantation for bone defects of critical size treatment expecting to restore the bone integrity, form new bone tissue in a site of bone defect, and reduce the rehabilitation period of a patient.\n\nThe data obtained from this study will have practical implications for the treatment of reparative osteogenesis alterations and will be based on the principles of evidence-based medicine"
