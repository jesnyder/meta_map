Vaccines will be administered by licensed providers.\n\nPrior influenza vaccine history will be verified by medical record review when possible.\n\nInjection-site (local) and systemic reaction data will be assessed on vaccination day and during the 8 days following vaccination using either identical web-based or paper diaries, depending on study participant preference.\n\nMaternal serum samples will be collected for antibody titers relevant to Influenza at time points that include: prior to vaccination and ~29 days post vaccination. When feasible, maternal blood at delivery and cord blood serum will be analyzed for the same antibody titers.\n\nPregnant women will be followed through delivery with comprehensive obstetric and neonatal outcomes obtained from medical record review for 90 days of life."

Estimated due date (EDD) and Gestational Age (GA-EDD) will be based on reconciliation of \"sure\" first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) and earliest dating ultrasound. If the LMP is uncertain, then the earliest dating ultrasound will be used to determine EDD and GA. If the ultrasound derived-EDD is in agreement with sure-LMP derived EDD, then the LMP-derived EDD is used to determine GA. If the ultrasound derived EDD is not in agreement with the LMP-derived EDD, the ultrasound-derived EDD is used to determine GA.\nEnglish or Spanish literate\nIntention of being available for entire study period and complete all relevant study procedures, including follow-up phone calls and collection of delivery information.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nInfluenza vaccine receipt during 2019-2020 or 2020-2021 influenza season prior to study enrollment.\nParticipation in this study in 2019-2020 influenza season\nAny condition that may interfere with assessment of local injection site reactions, e.g. obscuring tattoos\nKnown or suspected immunosuppression as a result of an underlying illness or treatment\nUse of anti-cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 36 months\nUse of oral or parenteral corticosteroids (≥ 20mg/day prednisone equivalent) or high-dose inhaled glucocorticoid for ≥ 14 consecutive days within the preceding 30 days\nHas an active neoplastic disease (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer), a history of any hematologic malignancy, current bleeding disorder, or taking anticoagulants (a daily aspirin is acceptable)\nHas a history of receiving immunoglobulin or other blood product (with exception of Rh immunoglobulin) within the 3 months prior to study vaccination.\nHistory of febrile illness (> 100.4°F or 38°C) within the past 24 hours prior to study vaccination\nContraindication to IIV or RIV receipt including history of severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of any influenza vaccine; or to a vaccine component, including egg protein\nHistory of Guillain-Barré syndrome within 6 weeks of a prior dose of any influenza vaccine\nReceipt of any licensed vaccine within 7 days prior to study vaccination or intention of receiving any vaccines during 8-day post-vaccination period\nReceipt of live vaccine during current pregnancy\nSigns or symptoms of active preterm labor, defined as regular uterine contractions with cervical change (dilation/effacement)\nKnown multi-fetal gestation or fetal congenital anomaly, e.g. genetic abnormality or major congenital malformation based on antenatal ultrasound\nAnyone who is already enrolled or plans to enroll in another randomized clinical trial with any drug, vaccine or medical device.
