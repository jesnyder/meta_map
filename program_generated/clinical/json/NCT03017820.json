      "BriefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus carrying the human NIS and IFN beta genes (VSV-hIFNbeta-sodium iodide symporter [NIS]) with or without ruxolitinib phosphate in treating patients with multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, or T-cell lymphoma that has come back or does not respond to treatment. A virus, called VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS, which has been changed in a certain way, may be able to kill cancer cells without damaging normal cells. Ruxolitinib phosphate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS and ruxolitinib phosphate may work better at treating multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia and T-cell lymphoma.",
      "DetailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS in different treatment regimens (alone [group A] and in combination with ruxolitinib phosphate [ruxolitinib] [group B]) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, or T-cell lymphoma and in combination with ruxolitinib and cyclophosphamide (group C) in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety profile of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS (alone and in combination with ruxolitinib).\n\nII. To estimate clinical response rate of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS (alone and in combination with ruxolitinib) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, or T-cell lymphoma overall and by disease type.\n\nIII. To estimate progression-free and overall survival of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS (alone and in combination with ruxolitinib) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, or T-cell lymphoma overall and by disease type.\n\nCORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination, and the biodistribution of virally infected cells at various times points after infection with VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS using planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) imaging.\n\nII. To assess virus replication, viremia, viral shedding in urine and respiratory secretions, and virus persistence after systemic administration of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS.\n\nIII. To characterize the pharmacodynamics (PD) of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS by way of measuring serum interferon-beta and also vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-real time (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS.\n\nIV. Assess CD8+ T cell (both general and VSV-IFNbeta-NIS specific) and natural killer (NK) cell responses.\n\nV. Gene expression analysis pre- and post-virotherapy. VI. Assess presence of VSV in tumor and normal tissues subsequent to administration of intravenous (IV) VSV-IFNbeta-NIS.\n\nVII. To identify the best dose of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS in the regimen being evaluated based on activity observed in the correlative measures described above in those dose levels identified as tolerable.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups.\n\nGROUP A: Patients receive VSV-IFNbeta-NIS intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients undergo SPECT/CT scans at baseline, and at days 3 and 8 after VSV-IFNbeta-NIS infusion.\n\nGROUP B: Patients receive VSV-IFNbeta-NIS IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and ruxolitinib phosphate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -1 to 9. Patients undergo SPECT/CT scans at baseline, and at days 3 and 8 after VSV-IFNbeta-NIS infusion.\n\nGROUP C: Patients receive VSV-IFNbeta-NIS IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and ruxolitinib phosphate PO BID on days -1 to 9. Patients also receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on day 2. Patients undergo SPECT/CT scans at baseline, and at days 3 and 8 after VSV-IFNbeta-NIS infusion.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days, and then every 3 months for up to 1 year or until progressive disease, then every 6 months for 1 year."
