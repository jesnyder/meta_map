      "BriefSummary": "ULSC-CV-01 is a clinical trial that comprises both Phase 1 and Phase 2a, which will be conducted sequentially. This trial will evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of allogeneic Umbilical Cord Lining Stem Cells (ULSC), which are a type of umbilical cord tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), with intravenous (IV) administration in hospitalized patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19.",
      "DetailedDescription": "The Phase 1, open-label, non-controlled trial in this study will investigate the safety of intravenous (IV) infusion of ULSC in a total of 20 patients with COVID-19-related ARDS that will include patients that are not intubated and not on a ventilator (NV) and patients that are intubated and on a ventilator (V) for respiratory support. Separate cohorts of each group (NV and V) will receive either a single dose (one infusion) or repeat dose (two infusions separated by 48-hour interval).\n\nThe Phase 2a randomized and placebo-controlled trial in this study will investigate the potential efficacy of IV infusion of ULSC in a total of 40 patients with COVID-19-related ARDS that will all be EITHER NV or V; the determination of that eligibility criterion and the ULSC dosing regimen will be based on Phase 1 data of safety and tolerability. Phase 2a will evaluate EITHER single dose (one infusion) or repeat dose (two infusions separated by 48-hour interval). The randomization will be 3:1 with 30 patients receiving investigational product (ULSC) and 10 patients receiving placebo (carrier control)."
