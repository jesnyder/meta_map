      "BriefSummary": "This phase I/II trial investigates the side effects of genetically engineered cells called FH-MagIC TCR-T cells and how well they work with atezolizumab in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer, urothelial cancer, or non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). T cells are infection fighting blood cells that can kill tumor cells. The T cells given in this study will come from the patient and will have a new gene put in them that makes them able to recognize MAGE-A1, a protein on the surface of tumor cells. These MAGE-A1-specific T cells may help the body's immune system identify and kill MAGE-A1 tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving FH-MagIC TCR-T cells with atezolizumab may help treat patients with triple negative breast cancer, urothelial cancer, or non-small cell lung cancer.",
      "DetailedDescription": "OUTLINE:\n\nThis is a phase I, dose escalation study of FH-MagIC TCR-T cells followed by a phase II study.\n\nLYMPHODEPLETION: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) and fludarabine IV on days -4, -3, and -2 before each T-cell infusion.\n\nT-CELL INFUSION: Patients receive FH-MagIC TCR-T cells IV over 15-20 minutes. Six to twelve weeks after first T-cell infusion, patients with progressive disease and non-persisting transgenic TCR T cells may receive a second T-cell infusion.\n\nIn the Phase 2 portion of the study, atezolizumab will be administered as standard of care beginning 24-72 hours after T-cell infusion. Atezolizumab will be given IV every 3 weeks for at least 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If an alternative PD1 inhibitor is instead available for a patient, it may be substituted instead.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for 15 years after final infusion of FH-MagIC TCR-T."

Confirmation of diagnosis must be or have been performed by internal pathology review of archival, initial or subsequent biopsy or other pathologic material at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC)/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA)/University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC). Patients with TNBC must meet the American Society of Clinical Oncology - College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) definition of negative estrogen, progesterone and HER2 receptor expression. Baseline tissue will be stained to confirm MAGE-A1 expression\nMeasurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria: Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one target lesion that can be measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >= 10 mm, unless lymph node in which case short axis must be >= 15 mm. Baseline imaging (for example diagnostic computed tomography [CT] chest/abdomen/pelvis and imaging of the affected extremity as appropriate), brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or CT scan) must be obtained within 45 days of prior to start of first planned FH-MAGEA1-A2TCR infusion. MRI can be substituted for CT in patients unable to have CT contrast\nPrevious treatment with standard of care (SOC) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies. Patients with NSCLC who have actionable somatic mutations or alterations in EGFR, ROS1 and ALK with FDA-approved drug therapy options will be eligible for study only after treatment with targeted therapies for those mutations have been offered or received. Patients with urothelial carcinoma who are candidates for enfortumab vedotin (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv) will be eligible for study after prior treatment with enfortumab vedotin-ejfv has been offered or received\nPrevious treatment with PD-1 axis inhibitor: Patients in Phase I/2 must have been offered or been previously treated with at least one dose of a PD-L1 axis inhibitor (e.g. PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibiting monoclonal antibody such as pembrolizumab, nivolumab, avelumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab). If received, they must have either developed progression or still have detectable disease and not have developed Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 3 or higher toxicity while on treatment. Patients may have received 1 or more prior systemic regimens for metastatic TNBC or NSCLC. There is no upper limit on prior regimens. Patients may have received prior anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting\nHLA type HLA-A*02:01: Participants must be HLA-A*02:01 in order for infused transgenic T cells in order to insure recognition of antigen-MHC complexes. HLA typing should be determined though a molecular approach in a clinical laboratory licensed for HLA typing\nLife expectancy must be anticipated to be > 3 months at trial entry\nCapable of understanding and providing a written informed consent\nIf fertile, willingness to comply with reproductive requirements\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2\nTumor tissue amenable to safe biopsy and subject willing to undergo serial tumor biopsies: Should there be no tumor tissue that is accessible for biopsy, patients will still be considered for participation, at discretion of the sponsor and in consultation with the investigator. Similarly, should an investigator determine that a biopsy cannot be performed safely for clinical reasons biopsies may be cancelled or retimed after confirming plan with the sponsor\nParticipants must be at least three weeks from last systemic treatment at the time of cell collection: At least 3 weeks must have passed since any: immunotherapy (for example, T-cell infusions, immunomodulatory agents, interleukins, vaccines), small molecule or chemotherapy cancer treatment, other investigational agents. There is no washout period for radiation, so long as radiated lesion is not the lesion being evaluated for RECIST measurements on the protocol. Bisphosphonates are permitted but the concurrent treatment with RANK ligand inhibitors (i.e., denosumab) is not permitted within 8 weeks of treatment\nSerum creatine < 2.5 mg/dL or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 30 mL/min\nTotal bilirubin (tBili) < 3.0 mg/dL. Patients with suspected Gilbert syndrome may be included if Tbili > 3 but no other evidence of hepatic dysfunction\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) < 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n=< grade 1 dyspnea and oxygen saturation (SaO2) >= 92% on ambient air. If pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are performed based on the clinical judgement of the treating physician, patients with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEVI) >= 50% of predicted and carbon monoxide diffusing capability test (DLCO) (corrected) of >= 40% of predicted will be eligible\nPatients 60 years of age or older are required to have left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) evaluation performed within 60 days prior to enrollment. LVEF may be established with echocardiogram or multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) scan, and left ejection fraction must be >= 35%. Cardiac evaluation for other patients is at the discretion of the treating physician\nAbsolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 500 cells/ mm^3\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nExpression of HLA B*4901: participants will be excluded due to the risk of alloreactivity\nParticipants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to enrollment. Childbearing potential is defined as women who have not been surgically sterilized and who are not postmenopausal (free of menses for at least 1 year)\nPatients with active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy are excluded. Case-by-case exemptions are possible with approval by principal investigator (PI)\nPrior solid organ transplant or allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant: Kidney transplant patients will be considered on a case-by-case basis requiring discussion with PI. If kidney transplant, patient must have dialysis access, dialysis plan, supportive nephrologist, willingness to stop transplant immunosuppression, and express understanding that rejection is possible outcome. Dialysis or costs related to transplant kidney will not be supported by the study.
