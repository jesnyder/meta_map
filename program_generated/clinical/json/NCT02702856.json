      "DetailedDescription": "The purpose of this multi-center clinical study is to determine the association of an Exosome Urine Test score with the presence of high Gleason grade / score (GS>/=7) prostate cancer on a prostate needle biopsy and validate the assay's performance characteristics in men presenting to their urologist with or without a previous negative biopsy, and recommended for an initial or subsequent biopsy. The results of this study are to support the use of this assay as a laboratory developed test. A secondary objective is to develop an assay that accurately predicts the presence of any Gleason grade prostate cancer in men at risk for prostate cancer."
