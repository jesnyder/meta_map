      "BriefSummary": "Background:\n\nResearchers want to test if certain cells can be re-programmed into stem cells. Stem cells can keep reproducing for a long time. Cells made by stem cells can be turned into different types of cells. These include cancer-fighting cells, skin cells, etc. The stem cells generated in this study will be used to make specific tumor-fighting cells that can recognize different types of mutations in cancer cells. They may also help identify new tumor mutations that may not have been identified yet.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo test if a certain type of tumor-fighting cells can be re-programmed into stem cells.\n\nEligibility:\n\nParticipants in another Surgery Branch protocol who are at least 16 years old\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants already gave samples of blood and/or tumor tissue in the other protocol. They do not need to come back to the clinic or give any other samples.\n\nParticipants will give consent for their samples to be used in this study.\n\nResearchers will obtain cells from the samples. They will grow those cells in the lab. They will create stem cells from them.\n\nResearchers will do genetic tests on the samples.\n\nMost tests will not show important health results. But if they do, the participant will be invited to talk to a genetic counselor and get more detailed testing to confirm the results.\n\nSome of the samples and results will be stored indefinitely. They may be used in future research. No personal information will be stored with them.\n\n...",
      "DetailedDescription": "Background:\n\nT-cells are potentially curative for patients with metastatic cancer, but many patients with cancer have T-cells that are terminally differentiated , a condition associated with treatment failure. We have observed that less differentiated T-cells have a greater capacity to proliferate, persist, and destroy large cancer deposits. Advances in regenerative medicine might allow the generation of rejuvenated T-cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC).\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo reprogram patient specimens into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and differentiate them into different types of somatic cells with the goal to produce cancer antigen-specific T-cells.\n\nTo make stored specimens and/or data available to approved research laboratories and investigators.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPatients enrolled on the National Cancer Institute Surgery Branch (NCI-SB) Cell Harvest protocol 03-C-0277 (Cell Harvest and Preparation for Surgery Branch Adoptive Cell Therapy Protocols).\n\nPatients willing to be consented on this protocol.\n\nDesign:\n\nCells and tissue obtained previously under protocol 03-C-2077.\n\nReprogramming of cells and tissue into iPSC lines.\n\nDerivation of iPSC lines into T-cells and iPSC progeny capable of supporting T-cell differentiation.\n\nGeneration of an iPSC-derived thymic organoid.\n\nScreening of tumor antigen specificity for regenerated T-cells.\n\nIn vivo analysis of regenerated T-cells."
