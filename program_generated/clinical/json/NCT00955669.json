      "BriefSummary": "Objective:\n\nTo compare the effect and safety of autologous transplantation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs) and mononuclear cells(MNCs) on Diabetic patients with Critical Limb Ischemia and Foot Ulcer.\n\nMethods:\n\npatients were randomized into the A group and the B group by use of a randomization table. One lower limb in A group or in B group was selected randomly for MSCs or MNCs transplantation as MSCs or MNCs group, the other lower limb in the same patient was selected for placebo（normal saline ,NS）injection as NS group.\n\nThe whole procedures of this clinical trial were blinded to both patients and investigators.Patients in both groups received the same ordinary treatment. Meanwhile, MSCs and MNCs were transplanted into the impaired lower limbs respectively. Follow-up index include: efficacy (pain,ulcer healing rate, lower limb amputation rate and ,ankle-brachial index,Transcutaneous oxygen pressure,magnetic resonance angiography) and safety (infection of the injection site, immunological rejection, and tumour generation).",
      "DetailedDescription": "RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Type 2 diabetic patients with bilateral critical limb ischemia (ankle-brachial index, ABI from 0.30 to 0.60) and at least with one foot ulcer, but without malignant tumor or gangrene above the ankle and/or severe coronary, cerebral and renal vascular disease, were eligible for the participation in this trial. Eligible patients took part in this study on a voluntary basis. They were randomized into the A and B group by use of a randomization table. One lower limb in A group or in B group was selected randomly for BMMSCs or BMMNCs transplantation as BMMSCs or BMMNCs group, the other lower limb in the same patient was selected for placebo（normal saline ,NS）injection as NS group. The whole procedures of this clinical trial were blinded to both patients and investigators.\n\nPreparation of Human Autologous Serum Preparation of MSCs and MNCs Flow Cytometric Analysis Examination of cells Safety Administration of therapy 5.0*108~5.0*109 MSCs and MNCs were transplant into impaired lower limbs by intramuscular injection.\n\nobservation index and assessment guidelines Statistical analysis"
