      "BriefSummary": "Open-label, non-randomised, single centre study which will assess the presence of reovirus (Reolysin®), following intravenous administration with or without Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) given to patients prior to surgery for metastatic melanoma. All patients will receive an initial low 'immunisation' dose of intravenous reovirus. Patients will be enrolled sequentially in to each of the two cohorts receiving either reovirus alone, or reovirus plus GM-CSF. For this study we anticipate 8-16 evaluable patients, up to 8 for each group. The endpoints of this study will compare the 2 treatment groups for reovirus tumour infiltration and replication. Compare the neutralising antibody development and cell-mediated immune response and identify any adverse events and laboratory toxicities.",
      "DetailedDescription": "This is an open-label, non-randomised, single centre study of intravenous reovirus (Reolysin®) with or without Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) given to patients prior to surgery for metastatic melanoma. Patients will be eligible if undergoing surgery for local control of lymph node involvement (with or without stage 4 metastases) or if planned for resection of cutaneous, subcutaneous, musculoskeletal or visceral metastases for local control, palliation of symptoms or personal choice.\n\nAll patients will receive an initial low 'immunisation' dose of intravenous reovirus (1x108 TCID50), to ensure that neutralising antibody (NAB) levels have risen by the time a full cycle of reovirus +/- GM-CSF is given. All patients will receive only 1 cycle of treatment which will comprise: i) For reovirus alone patients (Group A), 1x1010 TCID50 as a 1-hour IV infusion on 2 consecutive days; ii) For reovirus plus GM-CSF patients (Group B), subcutaneous GM-CSF (50mcg/day) for 3 days, followed by 2 days of reovirus. Both doses of reovirus will be at 1x1010 TCID50.\n\nPatients will be enrolled sequentially into each of the two cohorts receiving intravenous reovirus alone, or reovirus plus GM-CSF. The addition of GM-CSF is designed to address effects on the translational objectives/endpoints of this study, rather than primary toxicity, although all patients will be monitored for safety. Clinical assessment will be performed at screening (within 14 days of start of treatment), at day 1 (1st GM-CSF dose/none), day 8 and at the final study visit (40 days (+/- 14 days) post treatment with reovirus). Safety bloods will be taken at screening, at treatment (Day 1), before each dose of reovirus (Day 4 & 5), at Day 8 and at the final study visit (Day 40). Immunological assays, including reovirus antibody levels, will be performed before low-dose reovirus priming (Day -10 to -6), pre-treatment on Day 1, on Day 4 and 5 (pre-reovirus infusion and 60 minutes post-infusion), Day 8, and at the final study visit (Day 40). Patients with accessible skin or subcutaneous metastases will be asked for an optional additional pre-treatment biopsy which will be taken before low-dose reovirus priming.\n\nAll procedures will be performed as an outpatient or day case, apart from surgery in melanoma patients requiring admission as part of standard clinical care. Imaging will be as for standard clinical care only. Following surgical resection the tumour will be assessed for viral status and anti-tumour effects by e.g. standard histology, immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and electron microscopy. Further imaging and follow-up beyond the final study visit (Day 40 +/- 14 days) will be as for standard clinical care only."

It has been used as an immune adjuvant in therapeutic vaccines in pre-clinical and clinical studies, administered as cytokine released from gene-transduced tumour or stromal cells or as recombinant protein. At low doses GM-CSF may enhance migration and differentiation of dendritic cells to local antigen presentation, and is a potent adjuvant to generate specific systemic anti-tumour efficacy.",
