      "DetailedDescription": "For more than 20 years in clinical practice allogeneic transplantation of diploid fibroblasts (ADP) for burn wounds has been successfully used, it is used as an independent method, and a method of preparing wounds for autologous skin grafting [1].\n\nThe clinical efficacy of transplantation ADP, after the research done by E.V. Glushchenko; Rahayev AM [2,3] is not doubted.\n\nSeveral studies have shown the efficacy of stem cells in promoting faster and superior wound healing. Alexaki [4] successfully used adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells in wound healing in mice and compared their effect with dermal fibroblasts. The application of stem cells in wounds promoted more efficient reepithelialization by their proliferative effect on keratinocytes.\n\nIn recent years, the world's leading burn centers attempted to restore the skin over large areas of burn wounds by epidermal layers transplantation of allogeneic cells cultured in culture medium.\n\nThe information expected in the study will be based on the principles of evidence-based medicine and will have practical significance for the treatment of burn wounds.\n\nIt is expected to show a positive effect of cultured multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells in the epithelization of burn wounds process as well as the extent and speed healing of skin flap during autologous skin grafting."
