The first phase 1 part of the study includes six subjects openly receiving allogeneic Wharton's jelly derived mesenchymal stromal cells as the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP) Protrans, three each in the age ranges 7-11 and 12-18.The second part is a randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled phase 2 study in parallel design comparing allogeneic Wharton's jelly derived mesenchymal stromal cells treatment (as Protrans) to placebo in children and adolescent subjects (7-21 years of age) diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, The primary objectives of this study will be to investigate the safety, tolerance and efficacy after an allogieneic infusion of Wharton's jelly derived mesenchymal stromal cells."
