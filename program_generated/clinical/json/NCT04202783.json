      "BriefSummary": "This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of exosome deployment in patients with Craniofacial Neuralgia. Secondarily, this study is designed to rigorously evaluate for any adverse events that may be related to the administration and reception of exosomes.",
      "DetailedDescription": "The present study is designed to amplify the delivery of growth factors and anti-inflammatory agents to localized targets (determined by specific condition) by using focused transcranial ultrasound prior to intravenous infusion of exosomes. Exosomes delivered intravenously can be demonstrated to cross the blood brain barrier naturally. Exosomes are thought to play a normal physiological role in intercellular signaling, and demonstrate anti-inflammatory and pro-growth effects in preclinical models and clinical cases reports. Clinical trials have deployed exosomes intravenously and with intracerebral and intrathecal injection, and have claimed safety and clinical efficacy.\n\nFocused ultrasound has been shown to enhance local blood flow and has been presented as a non-invasive means of targeting delivery of therapeutic agents."

Baseline and outcome measures in this study utilize validated tests that are appropriate for repeated measures. The present study can be easily implemented because the neuropsychological testing instruments have been in routine clinical deployment providing for a high degree of availability and reliability. Quality assurance is tightly controlled. The study population is sufficiently broad and the conditions of interest are sufficiently prevalent so that recruitment of subjects is not a limiting factor.",
