      "BriefSummary": "This is a single center Phase I clinical trial of FT516 administered intraperitoneally (IP) once a week for 3 consecutive weeks for the treatment of recurrent gynecologic cancers. As this is an early 1st in human study and the 1st intraperitoneal infusion of FT516, the safety of FT516 is confirmed prior to adding enoblituzumab as an intravenous infusion approximately 1 week prior to the 1st dose of FT516 and every 3 weeks beginning on Day 22 (1 week after the last dose of FT516). Each dose of FT516 is followed directly by an IP infusion of interleukin-2 (IL-2) to facilitate natural killer (NK) cell survival. A short course of outpatient lymphodepletion chemotherapy is given prior to the 1st dose of FT516.",
      "DetailedDescription": "FT516 is an off the shelf product comprised of allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells, expressing high-affinity non-cleavable CD16 (FT516). Enoblituzumab is an Fc-optimized monoclonal antibody that targets B7-H3 which is highly expressed on ovarian cancer. Based on data showing that within the ovarian cancer tumor microenvironment surface expression of CD16a on NK cells is diminished, the researchers hypothesize that the FT516 cellular product containing a non-cleavable CD16 will bypass the low CD16 expression issue and maximize NK cell cytotoxicity. Enoblituzumab is an Fc optimized humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to B7-H3 (CD276). B7-H3 is an inhibitory immune checkpoint molecule that is widely expressed by a number of different tumor types and may play a key role in regulating the immune response. It is therefore hypothesized that the combination of FT516 with enoblituzumab will maximize NK cell cytotoxicity in patients with ovarian cancer."

The cohort size increases from 1 to 3 patients with 2 additional patients added. Escalation in Step 2 continues until the 1st DLT at which point Stage 2 continual reassessment method (CRM) is activated. If Cohort 5 is completed with 10 patients enrolled at the MTD without a DLT, Stage 2 (CRM) is not used. b) The 1st occurrence of a DLT the study moves directly to Stage 2 (CRM) and Step 2 is not used. c) Cohort 5 is completed without a pre-defined AE or a DLT - neither Step 2 nor Stage 2 is used if a total of 10 patients are enrolled in Cohort 5.",
