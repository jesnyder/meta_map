      "BriefSummary": "This is an interventional, single arm, multicenter, phase I/IIa clinical trial. The study objective is to investigate the efficacy and safety of three i.v. doses of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) allo-APZ2-ACLF for the treatment of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). The allogeneic IMP allo-APZ2-ACLF contains skin-derived ABCB5-positive mesenchymal stem cells isolated from skin tissue of healthy donors and stored in a donor cell bank.",
      "DetailedDescription": "This is an interventional, phase I/IIa clinical trial to investigate the efficacy (by changes in Model for End-Stage Liver Disease [MELD] score) and safety (by monitoring adverse events) of the IMP in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure grade 2 and 3. The allogeneic IMP allo-APZ2-ACLF contains skin-derived ABCB5-positive mesenchymal stem cells isolated from skin tissue of healthy donors and stored in a donor cell bank.\n\nThe clinical trial will be conducted in Germany and will consist of a screening, treatment and efficacy follow-up period, and a safety follow-up period.The total duration is planned to be about 3 years including the follow-up period.\n\nThe planned sample size is up to 18 treated patients. 2 x 10e6 cells/kg, each at Day 0, Day 5 (±1) and Day 13 (±1), will be administrated into peripheral vein (arm) by use of a perfusor. allo-APZ2-ACLF will be in a concentration of 1 x 10e7 cells/mL in HRG-solution. In patients which require dialysis, the IMP application has to be performed at least 3 hours after end of dialysis. This is necessary to ensure that cells and secreted molecules are not cleared from the system by the dialysis.\n\nPatients will be followed up for 24 weeks with clinic visits at Weeks 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 after IMP application. Further safety follow-ups will be scheduled as home interviews via telephone at Months 15 and 24. If necessary (at the discretion of the investigator), safety follow-ups at Months 15 and 24 can also be carried out as an on-site visit.\n\nThe first six patients will be enrolled into the clinical trial consecutively with an interval of 2 weeks between the third IMP-application of the first patient and the enrolment of the second patient, etc. During this period the patient receives all three applications and immediate severe adverse effects (allergic reactions, SIRS) that could occur after treatment would be reported before treatment start of the next patient.\n\nThe safety data of these first six patients will be reviewed by the Medical Monitor continuously, if required with assistance of the further members of the DSMB. The safety evaluation of the DSMB will be submitted to the PEI and recruitment can only be continued after approval of an amendment."
