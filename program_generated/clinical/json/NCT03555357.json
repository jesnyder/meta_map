      "BriefSummary": "This study will evaluate the efficacy of platelet injections for use of scar therapy post abdominoplasty operations.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Platelet therapy is quickly becoming an integral aspect of both medical and cosmetic procedures. Most notably, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) has been used in surgical settings to stimulate healing and promote tissue regeneration. In the field of cosmetic medicine, PRP has been used topically or as an injection to stimulate collagen production and enhance the efficacy of cosmetic procedures such as fat transfer, hair loss therapies, laser treatments, and microneedling. Harvested PRP has platelets, fibrin, and white blood cells, which contribute to wound healing, neocollagenesis, and elastogenesis. Platelet Rich Fibrin (PRF) is the next generation of PRP and contains very high concentrations white blood cells, fibrin and a small amount of mesenchymal stem cells found circulating in our bloodstreams. Due to a lack of anticoagulant in the tube, PRF becomes a gel after 15-20 minutes of being isolated. These properties make PRF useful in reconstructive and aesthetic medicine but may also be beneficial for scar therapy in the same way PRP is currently used.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of platelet rich plasma vs. platelet rich fibrin for scar therapy in abdominoplasty who are at least one-year post operation."
