      "BriefSummary": "The present investigation will be a Phase II, single center, placebo-controlled, randomized, dose escalation, infusion modality (intracoronary vs transendocardial injection using the Cordis Biosense NOGASTAR TM Mapping Catheter with the Biosense MYOSTAR TM left ventricular injection catheter) transplantation of an autologous (your own stem cells) combination of bone marrow-derived stem cells into myocardium for the treatment of severe coronary ischemia.\n\nThe purpose of this research study is to determine if the infusion of a combination of stem cells obtained from the bone marrow of the same patient will contribute to the formation of new blood vessels in patients with symptomatic severe coronary ischemia(CI).\n\nIn this trial we will determine whether the combination stem cell treatment is safe, feasible and results in the development of mature stable and/or collateral vessels and improvement of cardiac function.\n\nCoronary Ischemia (CI) is intractable angina due to severe coronary artery disease which can seriously decrease blood flow to the heart.\n\nCI needs a comprehensive treatment since the condition will not improve on its own. The overall goal of the treatment is to increase blood flow to the heart and improve symptoms of angina.\n\nThe study hypothesis is based on the concept that the process of formation of new blood vessels is complex and requires the participation of several types of stem cells and growth factors. The lack of any of these components will produce vessels which are immature and unable to provide appropriate blood supply to the heart.\n\nPatients eligible to participate in this study are those suffering from severe blockages of the vessels of the heart and are not candidates for percutaneous revascularization or surgical procedures.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Enrolled individuals (60) will be divided in 2 Treatment groups for the infusion of the cell /placebo product:\n\nTreatment Group A (30 individuals, including patients and placebo controls) will receive the product by intracoronary infusion,\n\nTreatment Group B (30 individuals, including patients and placebo controls) will receive the product by transendocardial injections.\n\nIn turn, each Treatment Group will consist of 2 subgroups of individuals that will receive the infusion of one of the two doses established of the cell product:\n\nIn treatment SubGroup 1, 10 individuals will receive the \"low dose\" of the cell product and 5 individuals will receive the placebo product.\nIn treatment SubGroup 2, 10 individuals will receive the \"high dose\" of the cell product and 5 individuals will receive the placebo product"
