      "BriefSummary": "In this study, researchers want to determine the safety of MSCs that a patient can tolerate without causing side effects. Moreover researchers will also be looking at the function of the knee over time, which may give them some insight on the usefulness of MSCs as a treatment option.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common forms of arthritis. It is a lasting condition in which the material that cushions the joints, called cartilage, breaks down. This causes the bones to rub against each other, causing inflammation, stiffness, pain and loss of joint movement. Currently, there are few effective treatments available for patients suffering from OA.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are cells that have the ability to self-regenerate, which means they have the ability to make copies of themselves and to turn into other kinds of cells (e.g. cartilage cells). Stem cell science shows much promise for the future treatment of osteoarthritis, but much of the research is still in the early stages. In this study, researchers want to determine the safety of MSCs that a patient can tolerate without causing side effects. Moreover researchers will also be looking at the function of the knee over time, which may give them some insight on the usefulness of MSCs as a treatment option."
