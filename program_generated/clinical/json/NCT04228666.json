      "BriefSummary": "Hope Biosciences is conducting a research study of an investigational product called autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (abbreviated as HB-adMSCs) as a possible treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study purpose is to evaluate the safety profile of four IV infusions of HB-adMSCs in subjects with clinical diagnosis of AD.",
      "DetailedDescription": "This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, non-randomized study in subjects with Alzheimer's disease. 24 patients will be enrolled for the study. The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the safety profile of four IV infusions of autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HB-adMSCs) in subjects with clinical diagnosis of AD. The primary endpoint of this study is to measure the number and frequency of adverse event(s) and/or severe adverse event(s) throughout the study duration. The second endpoint of this study is to evaluate the ability of HB-adMSCs to alter AD-related inflammation via measuring levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-a), Interleukin-1 (IL-1), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), and markers associated with amyloid deposition, Amyloid beta 40 and Amyloid beta 42. Subjects will also be assessed for cognitive deficits measured by changes from baseline values using Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), Alzheimer's disease Related Quality of Life (ADRQL), Altoida Neuro Motor Index (NMI) for Digital Biomarkers, and Clinical Dementia Rating Questionnaire (CDR)."

Acceptable forms of birth control include abstinence, birth control pills, or any double combination of intrauterine device (IUD), male or female condom and diaphragm.\nInformed consent signed by the subject\nDocumented Amyloid PET Scan (images and report) positive to amyloid plaques deposits on the brain.\nIf the patient is under any treatment, should have been on a stable dose for at least 30 days prior to signing the informed consent form and there is no intention to modify the dose over the course of the study. (NOTE: Cholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) (donepezil, galantamine, or rivastigmine) may not be initiated, discontinued or modified after study initiation for the 12-months control period).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nHospitalization or change of chronic concomitant medication within one month prior to screening.\n\nClinically significant or unstable disease that may interfere with outcome evaluations, including but not limited to:\n\nRespiratory Insufficiency\nPoorly managed hypertension (systolic >160 mm Hg and/or diastolic >95 mm Hg) or hypotension (systolic <90 mm Hg and/or diastolic <60 mm Hg); or\nBradycardia (<50 beats/min.) or tachycardia (>100 beats/min.). Otherwise healthy subjects with borderline bradycardia may be discussed with the medical monitor to determine eligibility.\nRenal insufficiency, defined as eGFR <40 mL/min based on the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) formula, https://www.mdcalc.com/ckd-epi-equations-glomerular-filtration-rate-gfr\nHeart disease (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, heart failure, cardiomyopathy within 3 months before screening). If a subject has a history of heart disease of questionable clinical significance, the medical monitor may be contacted to discuss eligibility.\nRecords of PET Scan negative to Amyloid plaques deposition in the brain.\nSuspected or known drug or alcohol abuse, i.e. more than approximately 60 g alcohol (approximately 1 liter of beer or 0.5 liter of wine) per day.\nAcute intercurrent infections such as Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or Syphilis.\nContraindications for PET scanning, including implanted metallic devices (e.g. non-MRI-safe cardiac pacemaker or neurostimulator; some artificial joints metal pins; surgical clips; or other implanted metal parts), or claustrophobia or discomfort in confined spaces.\nIs unable or unwilling to comply with protocol follow-up requirements.\nEnrollment in another investigational study or intake of investigational drug within the previous 30 days.\nAny condition, which in the opinion of the investigator or the sponsor makes the patient unsuitable for inclusion.",
