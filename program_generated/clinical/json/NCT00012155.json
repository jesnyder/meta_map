      "DetailedDescription": "OBJECTIVES:\n\nDetermine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of a single intrahepatic NV1020 injection in patients with hepatic metastases from colon cancer that has failed first-line chemotherapy.\nDetermine the tolerability of this drug in these patients.\nDetermine preliminarily the anti-tumor activity of this drug in these patients.\nAssess the immunogenicity of NV1020 in these patients.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.\n\nPatients receive a single intrahepatic arterial injection of NV1020 over 10 minutes with the aid of hepatic arteriography.\n\nCohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of NV1020 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\nPatients are followed at 1, 2, and 3 months post injection. Patients may participate in a separate long term (up to 1 year) follow-up study for continued assessment and monitoring.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study."
