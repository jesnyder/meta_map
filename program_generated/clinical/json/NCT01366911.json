      "BriefSummary": "This is a pilot study to provide preliminary data of the association between bone mineral denity adjacent to acetabular implants, as measured by quanitative computed tomography (QCT), at least 2 years post Total Hip Arthoplasty (THA) surgery with Mesechymal stem cell assays, obtained at time of surgery, and to begin to evaluate if stem cells can predict orthopaedic surgical outcomes.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Subjects who have undergone a THA and who previously consented to \"Stem Cell Quality Assays: Correlation with Aging/Health\" study which used excess bone marrow and blood samples to complete stem cell assay labs will be invited back at least 2 years post THA to complete bilateral hip x-rays, if not already completed as part of routine medical follow up plus a QCT bone density testing and to complete a questionnaire regarding smoking, alcohol and exercise history along with recording BMIs.\n\nThis ability to identify older individuals with compromised stem cell function could offer opportunities to develop and test new preventative and therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes."
