      "BriefSummary": "This is a Phase 1/2, Open-label, Multi-center, Clinical Trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Xeno-Skin® to provide temporary wound closure of severe and extensive deep-partial or full-thickness burn wounds until definitive wound closure can be achieved via permanent autografting.\n\nApproximately 15 total subjects will be enrolled. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria and provide written informed consent will receive Xeno-Skin® placement at a single burn wound site. The designated Xeno-Skin® product size will be placed on the burn wound following wound site preparation, including necessary debridement and tangential excision as determined by burn surgeon and secured in place via suturing or stapling. The remaining burn wound will be covered with human cadaver allograft and treated according to local standard of care with care to avoid any overlap or significant contact of the two temporary wound dressings. The Investigator will assess the wounds and identify the matched pair of burn sites then the treatments will be randomly assigned to the sites.\n\nXeno-Skin® will remain in place until intentional removal per Investigator's direction consistent with subject's overall clinical course, or if it is deemed to no longer provide effective wound closure and barrier function to the wound bed. The Investigator will follow local standard of care relevant to wound care and dressing changes while the Xeno- Skin® is in place. Standard of care burn management will be provided by the Investigator.\n\nRoutine vital sign assessments, photography, laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis), physical exams, and adverse event monitoring will occur while Xeno-Skin® is in place and for up to 1 year following initial placement. Subjects will be monitored via a passive and active screening program using blood samples collected at time points throughout the study period, as adapted from FDA Guidance for Industry.\n\nThe risk of transmission of infectious disease is expected to be extremely low and while limited human trial data are available there have been no reports of transmission of porcine microorganisms to humans, and to date, there have been no adverse events (AEs) related to the use of Xeno-Skin® observed or reported, and independent analysis of PERV data and medical records by the Safety Review Committee has indicated no evidence of zoonotic transmission in this trial.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Product Name: Xeno-Skin®\n\nChemical Name: alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase knock-out (GalT-KO) porcine (Sus scrofa) split-thickness skin\n\nChemical Structure: Xeno-Skin® is a live biotherapeutic, split-thickness, xenotransplantation skin product derived from specialized, genetically engineered (alpha 1,3 galactosyltransferase knockout [GalT-KO]), Designated Pathogen Free (DPF), porcine donors containing live (i.e. non-terminally sterilized) porcine cells, including endothelial cells of intact vasculature and those comprising the dermal and epidermal tissue layers.\n\nProposed Indication: Xeno-Skin® is indicated for the treatment of a serious condition and unmet medical need: severe and extensive deep-partial and full-thickness burn wounds requiring hospitalization, surgical excision, and skin grafting.\n\nDrug Type: Xeno-Skin® is classified as a Live Biotherapeutic Product (LBP). (Guidance to Industry, Early Clinical Trials with Live Biotherapeutic Products, Section 1.b.) Active Ingredient: Live (i.e. non-terminally sterilized) porcine cells, including endothelial cells of intact vasculature, and those comprising the dermal and epidermal tissue layers\n\nProduct Structure: Xeno-Skin® has an approximate thickness of 0.022 inches (0.55mm) and is currently provided in one investigational size: approximately 5x15 cm2 (22.5g/75 cm2).\n\nFormulation: Each lot or releasable batch of Xeno-Skin® is derived from a single source animal and each batch is independently processed and tested for various adventitious agents, histology, morphology, sterility, and purity.\n\nRoute of Administration: Surgical engraftment, via sutures or staples Dosing Regimen: Surgical engraftment, via sutures or staples, to provide temporary wound closure of severe and extensive deep-partial and full-thickness burn wounds requiring hospitalization, surgical excision, and skin grafting. The amount is of temporary wound dressing is based on the depth and size (TBSA) of the burn injury.\n\nDrug's Mechanism of Action: Patients with severe burns are at high risk of mortality due to a devastating sequela of complications such as increased capillary leak and release of inflammatory cytokines, infection from opportunistic pathogens, immune-compromise, hypovolemia, hypothermia, electrolyte and pH imbalances, and other detrimental deviations to pre-injury homeostasis as a result of a disruption in the skin barrier that contributes to organ failure and often death.\n\nXeno-Skin® provides a temporary barrier against infection, helps prevent fluid loss, and helps restore the functional skin barrier prior to definitive wound closure with the placement of an autograft. Xeno-Skin®'s inclusion of viable epithelial, epidermal, and dermal porcine cells permits revascularization of the wound bed, critical for efficient re-epithelialization and wound healing.\n\nThis mechanism of action closely mirrors today's clinical standard, human cadaver allograft. The same progression of wound healing processes occurs in both human cadaver allograft and Xeno-Skin®. This mechanism of action distinguishes Xeno-Skin® from traditional xenografts products on the market today, which are terminally sterilized, rendering the cells inactive, limiting their therapeutic capability.\n\nDrug Packaging: Each Xeno-Skin® product is individually packaged in a clear plastic, externally threaded, 10-ml polypropylene vial with threaded seal-cap, stored on a rolled, sterile nylon mesh backing on the dermal-side of the Xeno-Skin® product that serves to support and protect the graft during processing and transport. Within this container, each Xeno-Skin® product is individually immersed in 7-ml of sterile cryoprotective medium with 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (CryoStor CS5, BioLifeSolutions). Source animal serum is NOT included or used in this process. The contents are cryopreserved via controlled rate, phase freezer and stored at -80o C until use. All packaging materials are removed prior to the surgical procedure and dressing placement."
