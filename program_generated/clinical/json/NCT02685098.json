      "BriefSummary": "Patients undergoing semi-elective lower extremity major amputation from complications associated with atherosclerotic limb ischemia will received intra-muscular injections of allogeneic Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in the leg above and below the point of amputation to prevent ischemic wound complications after surgery and decrease the incidence of revision and further amputation.",
      "DetailedDescription": "This is a phase I single center open label trial study that will enroll sixteen patients requiring semi-elective lower extremity major amputation within a 30 day period for non-infectious complications related to critical limb ischemia (CLI). After enrollment patients will be scheduled for amputation 7 days after MSC administration. The investigational treatment uses allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells at the point of care. Allogeneic MSCs will be injected in the thigh muscles and the gastrocnemius muscle (for below knee amputation only) of sixteen patients undergoing major amputation. Through a review of treatment related adverse events over 6 months we will test the hypothesis that allogeneic MSCs do not result in significant cardiovascular, respiratory, or infectious treatment related adverse events. Through an exploratory investigation we will assess the efficacy of MSCs in promoting freedom from gangrene, revision of amputation, and death after major amputation."
