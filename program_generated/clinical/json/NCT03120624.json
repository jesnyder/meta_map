      "BriefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of vesicular stomatitis virus-human interferon beta-sodium iodide symporter (VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS) with or without ruxolitinib phosphate in treating patients with stage IV endometrial cancer or endometrial cancer that has come back. The study virus, VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS, has been changed so that it has restricted ability to spread to tumor cells and not to healthy cells. It also contains a gene for a protein, NIS, which helps the body concentrate iodine making it possible to track where the virus goes. VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS may be able to kill tumor cells without damaging normal cells. Ruxolitinib phosphate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS with ruxolitinib phosphate may work better in treating patients with endometrial cancer compared to VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS alone.",
      "DetailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the optimal dose schedule, safety and tolerability as measured by the incidence of significant toxicity of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS in immunocompetent patients with metastatic and/or recurrent endometrial cancer (EC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the toxicity profile of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS (alone and in combination with ruxolitinib phosphate [ruxolitinib]).\n\nII. To determine the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination, and the biodistribution of virally infected cells at various times points after infection with VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS (alone and in combination with ruxolitinib) using Tc-99m pertechnetate planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) or fluorine F18 tetrafluoroborate (TFB)-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.\n\nIII. To assess virus replication, viremia; viral shedding in urine and respiratory secretions; and virus persistence after intravenous (IV) administration of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS (alone and in combination with ruxolitinib).\n\nIV. To monitor humoral responses to the injected virus. V. To estimate the tumor response rate and overall survival.\n\nCORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS in patients with EC by measurement of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS in blood by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).\n\nII. To characterize the pharmacodynamics (PD) of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS by way of measuring serum interferon-beta and also VSV-RT-PCR of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS listed above.\n\nIII. Assess CD8+ T cell (both general and VSV-IFNbeta-NIS specific) and natural killer (NK) cell responses.\n\nIV. Gene expression analysis pre- and post-virotherapy. V. Evaluate transcription of interferon mediated genes (protein kinase R, the death receptor-TRAIL, 2'-5' oligoadenylate/RNAse L proteins, heat shock proteins [Hsp 60/70/90], major histocompatibility class antigens and IRF-7).\n\nVI. Assess presence of VSV in tumor and normal tissues subsequent to administration of IV VSV-IFNbeta-NIS.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM A: Patients receive VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS IV over 60-90 minutes on day 1. After 2 days, patients receive technetium Tc-99m sodium pertechnetate IV, and about 30 minutes later, undergo whole body planar imaging and SPECT/CT imaging or receive fluorine F18 tetrafluoroborate IV and undergo TFB-PET imaging. If previous imaging data are positive, patients receive technetium Tc-99m sodium pertechnetate IV and undergo another planar and SPECT/CT imaging or fluorine F18 tetrafluoroborate IV and undergo another TFB-PET imaging between 7-10 days and on 15 days if needed after VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS infusion. Biopsy of accessible NIS image-positive tumors may occur after any imaging. Patients also undergo image-guided biopsy of accessible tumor on day 29.\n\nARM B: Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 9. Patients also receive VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS IV over 60-90 minutes on day 1. After 2 days, patients receive technetium Tc-99m sodium pertechnetate IV, and about 30 minutes later, undergo whole body planar imaging and SPECT/CT imaging or receive fluorine F18 tetrafluoroborate IV and undergo TFB-PET imaging. If previous imaging data are positive, patients receive technetium Tc-99m sodium pertechnetate IV and undergo another planar and SPECT/CT imaging or fluorine F18 tetrafluoroborate IV and undergo another TFB-PET imaging between 7-10 days and on 15 days if needed after VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS infusion. Biopsy of accessible NIS image-positive tumors may occur after any imaging. Patients also undergo image-guided biopsy of accessible tumor on day 29.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 29, every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up to 5 years."
