      "BriefSummary": "Hope Biosciences is conducting a research study of an investigational product called autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (abbreviated as HB-adMSCs) as a possible treatment for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The study purpose is to evaluate the safety profile of a single IV infusion of HB-adMSCs in subjects with clinical diagnosis of RA.",
      "DetailedDescription": "This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, single-dose study in subjects with active Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). 12-15 patients will be enrolled for the study. The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the safety profile of a single IV infusion of autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HB-adMSCs) in subjects with clinical diagnosis of RA. The primary endpoint of this study is to measure the number and frequency of adverse event(s) and/or severe adverse event(s) throughout the study duration. The second endpoint of this study is to evaluate the ability of HB-adMSCs to alter RA-related inflammation via measuring levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-a), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and Joint Count 66/68 after a single infusion of autologous HB-adMSCs for up to 12-month post-infusion."
