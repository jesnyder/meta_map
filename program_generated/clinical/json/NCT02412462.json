      "BriefSummary": "This is a Phase 1 clinical study to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AB-16B5 in patients with an advanced solid malignancy. AB-16B5 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits the activity of the secreted form of clusterin (sCLU), a potent inducer of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Eligible subjects will have a disease that has been refractory to prior therapy and is unlikely to benefit from known therapies."
