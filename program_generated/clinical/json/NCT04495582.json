      "BriefSummary": "The study purpose is conducting follow-up surveillance for the incidence of adverse events and efficacy of subjects participated in phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (CS10BR05) in subjects with Multiple System Atrophy until 60 months from administering investigational product (IP).",
      "DetailedDescription": "Multiple system atrophy is a neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system which is accompanied by signs of autonomic imbalance (orthostatic hypotension, urinary problems and erectile dysfunction), Parkinson's symptoms (movement decreases and limb tremors) and cerebellar ataxia symptoms (grogginess and incorrect pronunciation). It shows signs similar to Parkinson's disease, however, it doesn't show improvement of symptoms by dopaminergic drugs and occurs at any age.\n\nThe purpose is conducting follow-up surveillance for the incidence of adverse events and efficacy of subjects participated in phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (CS10BR05) in subjects with Multiple System Atrophy until 60 months from administering investigational product (IP).\n\nBecause it is the following observational study for subjects participated in phase 1 trial, there is no additional administration of the investigational product in the study.\n\nIf the subjects who participated in phase 1 trial voluntarily consent in writing to take part in this observational study, the subjects visit the institution according to the protocol that designed the follow-up visits every 3 months (Visit 1, Visit 2) until 6 months from administration of investigational product and since then 6 months later (Visit 3), every 12 months (Visit 4~7) to observe the incidence of adverse events and efficacy.\n\nAs a result of evaluating severity of AE divided into subjective, objective in accordance with the CTCAE (Version 4.0) standards."
