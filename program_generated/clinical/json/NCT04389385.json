      "BriefSummary": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused mass mortality in the last 3 months that necessitates urgent development of new therapeutical agents. So far there is no effective anti-viral drug to reduce viral load that has critical importance to prevent progress into severe viral pneumonia and systemic hyper inflammation state. This project is to offer a biologic agent based on T cell derived exosomes. This is a novel approach using our proprietary protocols for drug development. This clinical trial is to test the safety and efficacy of this new agent following targeted delivery by metered dose inhaler. The project have received proper approvals from the Turkish Ministry of Health and Erciyes University, Kayseri Turkey. Turk-Patent Application Number: PCT/TR2020/050302",
      "DetailedDescription": "The Covid-19 disease due to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions people and caused thousands of mortality in the world over the last 3 months. Clinically, COVID-19 presents with a wide range of disease severity ranging from asymptomatic or very mild flu-like symptoms to very severe acute respiratory syndrome and multi-organ failure. The severity of COVID-19 correlates with escalating levels of systemic inflammation that eventually leads to hyperinflammatory stage resembling macrophage activation syndrome and death. Therefore, early intervention is essential to prevent progress into respiratory failure that requires reduction of viral load.\n\nThe virus-specific T-cells (VSTs) are body's natural immune defense against various disease-causing viruses. Donor originated COVID-19 specific T-cells (CSTC) are in vitro activated and expanded by exposing to viral peptide fragments in the presence of natural immune stimulant proteins called cytokines. These COVID-19 specific fragment peptides activate specific T-cells and stimulate the secretion of potent mediators including IFN gamma in forms of exosomes. We propose treatment of COVID-19 patients -who are at early stages of pulmonary disease- with CSTC-exomes to control disease progression. This biological agent offers universal application without a need for HLA match. Furthermore, exosomes are suitable as \"off the shelf product\" that allows dose titration for personalized treatment.\n\nThe purpose of this single arm open labeled, combined interventional (phase I/II trials) clinical trial is to explore the safety and efficiency of inhaled CSTC-exomes in the treatment of early stage novel coronavirus (NCV) pneumonia."
