The study duration is approximately 32 weeks, during that time the study subject will complete 1 screening visit, 6 infusion visits, one follow-up visit without infusion and one end of study visit. Next day telephone follow-up visits will occur following each infusion. Efficacy and safety labs as well as quality of life and VAS scores will be obtained."
