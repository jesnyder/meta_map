      "BriefSummary": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a disease characterised by pathological changes in the pulmonary arteries leading to a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure. Right ventricular failure is the main cause of death in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, and the ability of the right ventricle to adapt to the progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance associated with changes to the pulmonary vasculature in pulmonary arterial hypertension is the main determinant of a patient's functional capacity and survival.Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)are a subset of adult stem cells residing in many tissues, including bone marrow(BM), adipose tissue, umbilical cord blood. Recent experimental findings have shown the ability of MSCs to home to damaged tissues and to produce paracrine factors with anti-inflammatory properties, potentially resulting in reduction of inflammation and functional recovery of the damaged tissues.It was found that MSCs can significantly improve the pulmonary hemodynamics, lung tissue gross and decrease the pulmonary artery pressure, middle artery thickness and right cardiac hypertrophy by intravenous injection."
