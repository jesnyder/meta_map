      "BriefSummary": "This study will determine the safety of allogeneic stem cell therapy from healthy donors, for 2nd degree burn wounds of less than 20% Total Body Surface Area (TBSA), at four different dose levels.\n\nClinical evaluation will take place every 1 to 4 weeks intervals until wound closure, and then monthly for 6 months following the last administration of MSCs.\n\nOnce the safety and dose-response analysis in Phase 1 is completed, an expanded trial will be initiated to better examine the efficacy of MSC therapy in 2nd degree burn wounds. Phase 1 will establish the maximum safe dose that will be used in the Phase II trial."
