      "BriefSummary": "Umbilical mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) infusion is supposed be a promising regeneration therapy with mild side effect as indicated by large quantities of animal experiments and some clinical trials. There are few UC-MSCs clinical trials with regard to diabetes mellitus. The investigators hypothesize that infusion of USC-MSCs may provide multiple signals for beta-cell regeneration and even re-differentiate into local tissues in diabetes mellitus patients, resulting in improvement of diabetic control, of which the effect may be promoted by concomitant infusion of bone marrow mononuclear cells and maximized by intra-arterial pancreatic infusion through angiography."
