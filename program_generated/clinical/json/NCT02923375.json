The first eight participants will be enrolled in Cohort A and receive a CYP-001 dose of 1 million cells per kg, up to a maximum dose of 100 million cells, on Day 0 and Day 7. Subject to a safety review of data from Cohort A, an additional eight participants will be enrolled into Cohort B and receive a CYP-001 dose of 2 million cells/kg, up to a maximum dose of 200 million cells, on Day 0 and Day 7. The primary evaluation period concludes for each participant 100 days after the first dose of CYP-001. Participants will have study visits on Days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 60 and 100. Subsequently, participants will enter a long term follow-up period, which concludes 2 years after the first dose of CYP-001."
