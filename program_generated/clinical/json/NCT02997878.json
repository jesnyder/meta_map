All patients who have been recruited to and completed the 14-day reporting period in stage 1 will continue to be evaluated for outcomes as per Stage 2.\n\nThe primary objectives of Stage 2 are to investigate whether a single intravenous infusion of ORBCEL-C in patients with PSC and AIH:\n\n• Is safe and tolerated over the period of trial follow up (up to 56 days)\n\nFor PSC patients only • Reduces serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in patients with PSC. This is a non-invasive biochemical surrogate of clinical outcomes in PSC\n\nFor AIH patients only\n\n• Reduces serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in patients with AIH. This is a non-invasive biochemical surrogate marker of hepatic inflammatory activity and outcomes in AIH.\n\nThe secondary objectives of Stage 2 are to investigate whether a single intravenous infusion of ORBCEL-C elicits a change over the duration of the study after treatment in patients with PSC and AIH:\n\nLiver biochemistry and function, immunoglobulin G concentrations (in AIH patients) and composite risk scores\nNon-invasive clinical markers of fibrosis\nPatient quality of life (QoL)\nSeverity of co-existent IBD in patients with PSC.\n\nFurther exploratory research objectives of the trial determine whether MSC infusion modulates the immune response by measuring whether treatment elicits a change in patients with PSC and AIH:\n\nMarkers of immune activation including immunoglobulin values and C-reactive protein concentration\nMarkers of biliary injury including total bile acid levels\nCirculating inflammatory cells profile this includes phenotypic expression of T regulatory cells (Tregs) a common mechanistic primary endpoint\nEndothelial cell activation markers such as VAP-1 and ICAM1\nSerum cytokine, chemokine, microRNA and RNA expression profiles"
