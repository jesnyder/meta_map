      "DetailedDescription": "Crohn´s disease (CD) can affect any part of the digestive system and symptoms of this chronic illness include abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. CD also causes bowel wall ulcers, strictures and fistulas (abnormal passages from the intestines to another organ or the skin).\n\nThere is an unmet need for effective medical therapy in CD patients with perianal fistulas, not responding to the conventional strategies, including biological therapies. The current study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of Allogeneic Umbilical Cord-derived Mesenchymal Stem cells from healthy donors for the treatment of perianal fistulas in patients presenting CD.\n\nPrimary objective: To assess the safety (incidence of treatment emergent adverse-events) of TH-SC01"
