      "DetailedDescription": "According to the medical history and the results of the examination, the selected cases were screened and the informed consent was signed. After hysteroscopy, the collagen/umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell was spread on a foley catheter, and placed in the uterine cavity, and 5 ml of saline was filled into the balloon. B-ultrasound confirmed that the stent was attached to the uterine wall. The balloon was removed in situ after 1 week. We mainly compare the endometrial thickness before and 6 months after surgery."
