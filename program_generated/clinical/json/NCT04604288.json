      "BriefSummary": "This is an Individual Patient Expanded Access IND of autologous adipose derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells with the primary goal of treating 1 individual with advanced left Hip Osteoarthritis (HOA) who has exhausted all treatment options The subject will receive 1 autologous HB-adMSCs intravenous infusion of 200 million (2 x 10⌃8 cells) total cells, and 1 autologous HB-adMSCs intra-articular injection into the left hip of 100 million (1x10⌃8) total cells.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Once eligibility has been confirmed, the subject will return approximately 14 days later for a single autologous HB-asMSC intra-articular injection in the left hip with 100 million (1x10⌃8) cells/2ml. At this visit, the following procedures will occur:\n\nA verification of patient consent will be verbally performed\nReview of medical history, and concomitant medications.\nPhysical examination.\nVital signs (Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Respirations, Temp., SpO2)\nWeight measurement\nBlood samples will be collected for baseline efficacy laboratory assessments:\n\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-Reactive Protein.\n\n•. A \"time-out\" verification of patient/consent/procedure/cell product will be performed prior to intra-articular injection.\n\nBaseline Pain assessments, Index of Severity and Disability scoring will be obtained at this visit.\nAdverse events monitoring The subject will then be monitored for a minimum of 1hr after the investigational product administration.\n\nForty-eight hours (2 days) after the intra-articular injection, the subject will return for a single autologous intravenous infusion of 2 x10⌃8 cells infused over 1 hour at 250mL/hr. The patient will be closely monitored during the infusion and for a minimum of 1 hour after. At this visit, the following procedures will occur:\n\nA verification of patient consent will be verbally performed.\nReview of medical history, and concomitant medications.\nPhysical examination\nVital signs (Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Respirations, Temp., SpO2)\nWeight measurement\nPatient pain assessment - Visual Analog Scale.\nDuring this visit a video recording will be made with the purpose to capture patient's overall status (gait, range of motion assessments, etc.).\nAdverse events monitoring\n\nFollow-up visits will occur at weeks 4 and 12. At these visits, the following procedures will occur:\n\nReview and update of medical history\nUpdate concomitant medications list\nWeight measurement\nVital signs (Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Respirations, Temp., SpO2)\nPhysical examination\nBlood samples will be collected:\n\nHematology Chemistry Coagulation Panel Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-Reactive Protein.\n\nPatient pain assessment - Visual Analog Scale\nIndex of Severity for Osteoarthritis of the Hip by Lequesne et al.\nWOMAC Survey Form\nICOAP: Measure of Intermittent and Constant OA Pain\nDuring this visit a video recording will be made with the purpose to capture patient's overall status (gait, range of motion assessments, etc.).\nAdverse Events Monitoring\n\nThe End of Study Visit will occur at week 26. At this visit, the following procedures will occur:\n\nReview and update of medical history\nUpdate concomitant medications list\nWeight measurement\nVital signs (Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Respirations, Temp., SpO2)\nPhysical examination\nBlood samples will be collected:\n\nHematology Chemistry Coagulation Panel Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-Reactive Protein.\n\nPatient pain assessment - Visual Analog Scale\nIndex of Severity for Osteoarthritis of the Hip by Lequesne et al.\nWOMAC Survey Form\nICOAP: Measure of Intermittent and Constant OA Pain\nDuring this visit a video recording will be made with the purpose to capture patient's overall status (gait, range of motion assessments, etc.).\nAdverse Events Monitoring\nChest X-ray (PA single view)\nHip MRI without contrast\nDuring this visit a video recording will be made with the purpose to capture patient's overall status (gait, range of motion assessments, etc.).\nAdverse Events Monitoring"
