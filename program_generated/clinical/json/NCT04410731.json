Target accrual is 10 subjects with diagnosis of painful lumbar facet joint arthropathy. Eligible subjects will receive a single set of intra-articular bilateral injections of allogeneic, culture-expanded BM-MSCs human, allogeneic, culture expanded, bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Subjects will be evaluated at baseline, treatment day 0, post-operative day 1, post-operative days 3-5, week 2, and months 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months post-treatment."
