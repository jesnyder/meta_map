      "BriefSummary": "Human Umbilical Cord-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSC) and Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cells (BMMC) from the patient injected into the spinal fluid intrathecally and injected intravenously (IV) is a safe and therapeutic procedure for spinal cord injury (SCI) patients.",
      "DetailedDescription": "The proposed study will assess primary safety and secondary efficacy endpoints of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells and allogeneic human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells administered to 20 male and female subjects between ages of 18-50 with spinal cord injury. These cells will be administered intrathecally and intravenously multiple times over the course of one month.\n\nThe primary objective is freedom from treatment-associated adverse events at 3 and 12 months post-treatment. Secondary objective will be efficacy at baseline, 3 months and 12 months and will be quantified based on the following: American Spinal Cord Injury Association (ASIA) classification and the Frankel Scale."
