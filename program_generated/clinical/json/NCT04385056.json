      "DetailedDescription": "While the pathophysiological changes that result in the symptoms of bradykinesia are poorly understood, an inflammatory component appears to be involved. Human umbilical cord-derived allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have documented anti-inflammatory properties, which suggest these cells may be effective at treating Bradykinesia. It is understood that perinatal products are potent immune modulators. It is believed that the positive symptomatic effects are secondary to the modulation of the immune system, and specifically the reduction in pathological inflammation. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of umbilical cord-derived allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells to treat patients with Bradykinesia."
