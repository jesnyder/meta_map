      "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of using Ossium vertebral Bone Marrow Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (vBM-MSC) to treat people with an ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) who develop a fistula in the setting of Crohn's disease of the pouch.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) remains the procedure of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). IPAA allows at risk tissue to be removed with restoration of intestinal continuity while maintaining favorable long-term functional outcomes and quality of life.1 2 While less than 30% of patients experience short-term postoperative morbidity following IPAA,3-5 up to 15% of pouches will ultimately fail due to technical or inflammatory complications, the majority of which manifest as a fistula from the pouch to the perianal or vaginal locations.1,2,6-8 Pouch failure due to a fistula tract is notoriously difficult to treat. Despite immunosuppressive medications and attempts at local repair, most patients will end up with a pouch excision and permanent ostomy. This can be a devastating outcome in some patients as it impacts body image and quality of life.1\n\nGiven the high safety profile, and relative success in treating perianal disease, we sought to use a GMP grade allogeneic bone marrow derived MSCs to establish safety and secondarily monitor for healing in patients with ileal anal anastomosis and ileal pouch fistulas. This trial will use allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to produce regenerative signals.\n\nThis study will enroll adult men and women who have undergone IPAA at least six months prior and now have a peri-pouch fistula related to Crohn's disease of the pouch. Subjects who are refractory to conventional medical therapy will be considered. Subjects enrolled will be those that meet current indications."
