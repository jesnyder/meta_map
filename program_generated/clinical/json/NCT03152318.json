      "BriefSummary": "This research study is evaluating an investigational drug, an oncolytic virus called rQNestin34.5v.2. This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug as a possible treatment for this diagnosis of recurrent or progressive brain tumor.",
      "DetailedDescription": "This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug as a possible treatment for this diagnosis. \"Investigational\" means that the intervention is being studied.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved rQNestin34.5v.2 as a treatment for any disease. This is the first time that rQnestin34.5v.2 will be given to humans.\n\nThe research drug, rQNestin34.5v.2, is an oncolytic viral vector made from the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1). The large majority of humans already have regular HSV1 in their nervous system. Normally, this virus can cause cold sores in areas like the lips, fingers and genitals in humans by making copies of itself in normal healthy cells. In some cases, HSV1 can cause severe infection of the brain and liver and/or death. However, scientists have removed or changed parts of the rQNestin virus being used on this study so it can only make copies of itself in glioma cells and not normal healthy cells.\n\nIf it is effective, the rQNestin34.5v.2 drug will spread to a glioma cell, kill it, and then make a copy of itself and spread again. This should be repeated over and over until all glioma cells are reached. If rQNestin34.5v.2 moves into a normal brain cell, it should not grow and make copies, and therefore should not spread to other normal brain cells.\n\nThe purpose of this research study is to test if rQnestin34.5v.2 is safe to use in humans, and if it is effective in treating malignant glioma. This study is also looking for the highest dose of rQNestin34.5v.2 that can be given safely to people with malignant brain tumors."

      "EligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\nAt the time of surgery, frozen biopsy confirmation of high grade or malignant glioma by neuropathologist. Biopsy confirmation of glioma or infiltrative glioma at time of surgery will be acceptable, provided that subject has prior pathology confirmation of high-grade glioma. If subject had previous diagnosis of low grade glioma, then the biopsy must show high grade glioma. To be confirmed at time of surgery, after registration in OnCore.\nParticipants must have prior diagnosis of glioma (astrocytoma, malignant astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, mixed oligo-astrocytoma), exclusive of ependymoma, ganglioglioma, pylocytic/pylomyxoid astrocytoma as confirmed by a neuropathologist or by a previous local pathology report.\nPrior history of external beam radiotherapy ≥ 5,000 cGy delivered to the tumor at least 4 weeks prior to registration. Participants over the age of 70 with prior history of hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy will also be accommodated, in accordance with NCCN guidelines; For participants with diagnosis of oliogodendroglioma or anaplastic oligodendroglioma, prior history of external beam radiotherapy < 5,000 cGy or no history of radiation are both acceptable\nPrior history of temozolomide chemotherapy provided concurrent to external beam radiotherapy and after as per current standard of care. However, temozolomide would not be required to have been provided concomitantly or after radiation if the patient had unmethylated MGMT promoter or if the patient initially was diagnosed with a low grade glioma. At least 4 weeks must have passed from the last dose of temozolomide and first dose of cyclophosphamide and/or rQNestin34.5v.2; 3.1.4.1 For participants with diagnosis of oliogodendroglioma or anaplastic oligodendroglioma, chemotherapy may have been administered before, during, or after radiation or not at all.\nIf participant was treated with bevacizumab, at least 4 weeks must elapse before treatment with either agent (Cyclophosphamide or rQNestin34.5v.2);\nRecurrent lesion must be ≥ 1.0 cm in diameter as determined by MRI;\nNormal hematological, renal and liver function as defined below: Leukocytes ≥3,000/mcL; Absolute lymphocyte count > 500/ mcL; Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL; platelets ≥100,000/mcL; PT or PTT <1.5 x institutional upper limit; Hemoglobin >10.0 g/dL; Total serum bilirubin within normal institutional limits; AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal; Serum creatinine within normal institutional limits OR Creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels above institutional normal;\nKarnofsky Performance Score ≥70.\nAge ≥ 18 years;\nAbility to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document;\nThe effects of rQNestin34.5v.2 and cyclophosphamide on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because cytotoxic & immunomodulating agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation including 3 months following the study. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study and for the duration of study participation including 3 months following the study. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 48 hours of study registration.\nSteroid regimen stable or decreasing for at least 7 days prior to inoculation;\nAbility to undergo MRI scanning with contrast;\nSubjects with any recurrence (first, second, third, etc recurrence) will be able to be enrolled.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nParticipants who exhibit any of the following conditions prior to initiating study treatment will not be eligible for this study:\n\nParticipants with significant renal or liver disease\nParticipants with progressive systemic malignancy.\nKnown chronic infections with HIV, hepatitis B or C; participants with a history of resolved Hepatitis A may be included in the trial.\nParticipants with active viral, bacterial or fungal infection requiring concurrent antiviral or antibiotics.\nSubjects with active HSV1 infection on current valacyclovir, acyclovir or ganciclovir therapy must be off treatment with any of these agents at least 7 days prior to surgery.\nHistory of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to cyclophosphamide (only for arm B).\nActive, known, or suspected immunosuppressive disorders, such as acquired or congenital immune deficiency syndromes and autoimmune diseases\nUnacceptable anesthesia risk\nSerious cardiopulmonary medical condition\nPregnant or lactating females\nRecurrent glioma where injection in either arm A or B of the biologic agent would require access and/or considerable spillage into the ventricular system.\nPrior participant in another protocol using an investigational agent or device within 5 half-lives or 4 weeks of the investigational agent, whichever is shorter.\nKnown HIV seropositivity.\nConcurrent therapy with drugs active against HSV (acyclovir, valaciclovir, penciclovir, famciclovir, ganciclovir, foscarnet, cidofovir). Participants must be off treatment with these agents for at least 7 days prior to surgery.\nActive oral or genital herpes lesions.\nParticipants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\nParticipants who are receiving any other investigational agents. Previous rQNestin34.5v.2 participants may be re-enrolled if they completed at least the day 56 assessment without DLT.\nUncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\nParticipants with tumor ≤ 1 cm proximity to the ventricles will be allowed to enroll. However the study agent (rQNestin34.5v.2) may not be injected in any area that is within 1 cm of the ventricle regardless of where the tumor is located.",
