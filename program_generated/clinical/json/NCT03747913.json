      "BriefSummary": "It is already known from literature that exercise mobilizes stem and progenitor cells into the peripheral blood. However, the exact mechanisms thereof remain to be fully elucidated.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that exercise-induced oxidative stress could be at least one of the responsible mechanisms and therefore want to study the exercise-induced stem and progenitor cell mobilization in a group of healthy young men when they exercise with, compared to when they exercise without antioxidative supplementation.\n\nThe primary outcome is numbers of stem and progenitor cells in the peripheral blood after an acute bout of exercise. As a secondary outcome, numbers of apoptotic mature and immature cells in the blood will be analysed."
