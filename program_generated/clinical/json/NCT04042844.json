Subjects that have a current diagnosis of chronic lumbar disc disease and meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled.\n\nSubjects randomized to active treatment will undergo bone marrow harvest for processing into BRTX-100 for intradiscal injection. Subjects randomized to control will undergo sham bone marrow harvest and intradiscal injection procedures. Subjects will return to the study site for a visit at Week 2, Week 12, Week 26, Week 52 and Week 104/Early Termination.\n\nAn independent, chartered, Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review all unblinded safety data for the first 10 subjects through Study visit 4 (day 14 post dosing) and prior to dosing of the 11th subject. All subjects will be randomized (2:1) to receive either intradiscal BRTX-100 or saline. A central randomization will be used."
