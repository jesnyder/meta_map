      "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether a one-time injection of allogeneic mesenchymal bone marrow cells is safe and beneficial in the treatment of photodamage on the face.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been isolated from a number of sources, including bone marrow, adipose tissue, and peripheral blood. The MSCs manufactured for this study are a subset of non-hematopoietic stem cells derived from the bone marrow of healthy, adult donors. These cells have the ability to migrate to areas of injury in the body and can differentiate into multiple cell types, including cutaneous cells. In addition to contributing directly to repair of the skin by replacing damaged cells, MSCs also stimulate the body's own cells to regenerate.\n\nThough an increasing number of patients are seeking remedies for photoaged skin, current treatments, ranging from topical medications to laser peels, are not ideal methods for addressing the medical need. Because MSCs have been shown in clinical and non-clinical applications to be useful in wound healing, it is also possible that the cells will have a similar effect in skin rejuvenation.\n\nIn the present study, we will determine the efficacy and safety of intravenously delivered MSCs in otherwise healthy patients with significant cutaneous photodamage."
