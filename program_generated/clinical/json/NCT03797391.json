The study consists of two parts: Phase I (dose escalation) and Phase II (cohort expansion). The study is planning to recruit tentatively 33-66 subjects with advanced/metastatic solid tumors in phase I and approximately 42-120 subjects with EGFR mutant and/or cMET aberrated NSCLC who have progressed on or are intolerant to standard treatment(s) (including platinum-based therapy) will be enrolled at the RP2D(s) in phase II part of the study. In phase II, patients will be assigned to five groups according to their molecular status at baseline. The trial will consist of molecular pre-screening period (Phase II only), clinical screening period (-28 to -1 days), treatment cycles (each cycle is 28 days, maximum up to 2 years), and safety follow-up period (30 days after the last dose)."
