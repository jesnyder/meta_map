      "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to compare the pain, functioning and pain medication consumption of knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients who have allogenic cytokines derived from human amniotic membranes (HAM) and allogenic mesenchymal stem cells derived from human umbilical cord Wharton's Jelly (HUMCWJ) implanted into the affected knee with knee OA patients who self-select to be in a non-intervention control group.",
      "DetailedDescription": "A total of 60 patients will be recruited from Scott Medical Health Center in Pittsburgh, PA. Inclusion criteria for the study are knee OA patients who are eligible for HAM and HUMCWJ therapy of their knee, no previous HAM or HUMCWJ therapy, between the ages of 50-85, independently residing in the community, no previously diagnosed cognitive decline or mental illness, and not taking pain medication more than once per week for a condition other than knee OA. Recruitment will be done in two parts as participants will self-select to participate in one of two study groups. All participants who elect to have the procedure done at the initial consultation, meet inclusion criteria, and agree to be in the study will be placed in Group 1. Participants who do not wish to have the procedure, meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, and agree to be in the study will be placed in Group 2. Those participants who are unsure about the procedure and need more time to decide will be contacted 2 weeks later and then group will be determined by their decision. All participants will be required to sign a written informed consent prior to data collection. Following written consent, all participants will undergo data collection (T0). At T0, participants will complete a demographic and medication use questionnaire, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), knee survey, and be timed during a single trial of three functional tasks. Participants will also provide a pain rating while completing each of the functional tasks. Group 1 will then undergo HAMS injection to the OA affected knee immediately following the testing battery. Group 2 will delay the HAMS injection to the OA affected knee for at least 3 months or never receive the injection. All participants will complete T1 data collection approximately 4 weeks following completion of T0 data collection and T2 data collection approximately 3 months following completion of T0 data collection. The T1 and T2 data collections will use the same data collection procedures and questionnaires."

The Physician will insert the needle fully into the joint space and begin to expel the fluid. He will achieve a continuous injection flow as he withdraws the needle back out of joint space. Immediately following the SURGENEX SurForce® injection, an injection of Predictive Biotech CORECYTE(TM) (1 cc) allograft umbilical cord-derived Warton's Jelly tissue matrix will be administered.
