      "DetailedDescription": "This is a prospective, single center, randomized, double blind, controlled Phase 1b/2a study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single injection into the knee joint of two different doses of MPCs combined with Hyaluronan compared to Hyaluronan alone in patients who have recently undergone an Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction.\n\nAll subjects in this study have undergone unilateral ACL reconstruction surgery within six months of injury. MSB-CAR001 plus Hyaluronan at one of two doses or Hyaluronan alone will be injected into the knee joint.\n\nAfter the screening and injection visits, each subject will be evaluated clinically within 3 days and 28 days after surgery, and at 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after surgery. The radiographical exams will be performed at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after surgery.\n\nSubjects will be evaluated at 24 months after surgery for safety."
