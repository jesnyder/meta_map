      "BriefSummary": "This project is to determine the safety and explore the effectiveness of allogeneic (not cells of the participant but those of another human) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in decreasing inflammation and possible enlargement of the participants' abdominal aortic aneurysm. Participants will be selected as a possible subject because of an abdominal aortic aneurysm discovered on the ultrasound or computed tomographic (\"CT\") scan requested by the participants' doctor.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to collect information that will be used to determine if MSCs can be used to decrease inflammation and possibly slow down enlargement of the participants' aneurysm. The investigators will also be collecting blood samples to study special inflammatory cells that cause aneurysms as well as asking participants to have a \"PET\" (positron emission tomography) scan that can measure inflammation directly in the participants' aneurysm.",
      "DetailedDescription": "This is a phase I, double blinded trial that will enroll 50 patients with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) measuring 3-5 cm in maximal transverse diameter (MTD). This study will assess the safety of MSCs in doses of 1 million MSCs/kg. or 3 million MSCs/kg. delivered intra-venously. This trial test the hypothesis that MSCs, in a dose dependent fashion, promote the frequency and immune suppressor function of CD4+CD25+ FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells and decrease AAA inflammation as measured by 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). The primary safety endpoints will be incidence of treatment related adverse events accrued over 24 months. Efficacy measures are changes in frequency and immune suppressor function of Tregs, number and cytotoxic activity of CD4+/CD8+ CD28- T-cells, activated monocytes, and changes in aortic inflammation as measured by uptake of 18-FDG PET/CT compared to baseline. Incidence of surgical intervention, aneurysm related death, quality of life, and major adverse cardiac events will be recorded."
