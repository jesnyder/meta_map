      "DetailedDescription": "This phase IIb study is a prospective, single-blind, parallel, active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chondrochymal® in subjects with knee OA. All the subjects will be enrolled in Taiwan. The target population is composed of subjects with unilateral or bilateral OA knee(s). For subjects with bilateral OA knees, only the knee with more severe symptoms will be selected as the target knee. If the severities of the OA symptoms are the same for both knees, the knee with more pain should be selected, where the WOMAC pain score will take the priority over the VAS index. Eligible subjects will be randomized into one of the study groups, Chondrochymal® Group or Control Group, in 1:1 ratio. To keep the blindness, the subject's eyesight will be masked by a curtain while receiving the IA injection."
