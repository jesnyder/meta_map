Subjects will be screened at the time of emergency room presentation. From the emergency room, subjects will proceed to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where the PCI will be completed and PEP will be administered. Subjects will be followed for one year after PEP administration through clinic visits.\n\nIn the event there are patients enrolled with unknown COVID-19 status or previously negative COVID-19 status and subsequently found to be positive by SARS-Cov-2 PCR testing at visit 1, visit 4, visit 6, or any unscheduled visit within the first 14 days after receiving the study drug, then those patients will be excluded from the primary endpoint analysis."
