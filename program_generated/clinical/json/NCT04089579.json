      "DetailedDescription": "The purpose of this double blinded Phase II study is to determine the efficacy of human umbilical cord tissue-derived mesencymal stromal cells (hCT-MSC), administered in two different dosing strategies, in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\n\nThis study will be enrolling children with ASD, aging 4-11 years of age. Qualifying subjects will undergo neuropsychological evaluation, EEG testing, eye tracking, CVA assessments, and infusion of study product. Subjects will be randomized to one of two study arms; 1) a single infusion of 6.0x106 cells/Kg at baseline, followed by a blinded placebo infusion at six months or, 2) Placebo infusion at baseline, followed by an intravenous dose of 6x106 cells/Kg at six months.\n\nThe primary endpoint of this study is the change in social communication skill from baseline to six months. The potential risks associated with infusion of MSCs include a reaction to the product (rash, shortness of breath, wheezing, difficulty breathing, hypotension, swelling around the mouth, throat or eyes, tachycardia, diaphoresis), transmission of infection, and HLA sensitization."
