      "BriefSummary": "Targeting patients with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, the purpose of this study is as follows: to confirm short-term efficacy by observing changes and transitions in cardiac function and clinical symptoms compared with each patient's baseline (before and after comparison) by human iPS cell-derived cardiomyocyte sheet transplantation, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability including the combined use of immunosuppressants.",
      "DetailedDescription": "The objective of this study is to confirm the efficacy and safety of a human (allogeneic) iPS cell-derived cardiomyocyte sheet in combination with an immunosuppressant for ischemic cardiomyopathy patients. The primary evaluation items will be improvement of left ventricular systolic function (LVEF) for efficacy, and safety will be assessed by blood tests, general laboratory tests, and other safety-related evaluations. Secondary evaluation items are NYHA functional evaluation, left ventricular remodeling evaluation by echocardiography, hemodynamic evaluation, physical activity function evaluation such as 6MWD and SAS, QOL, and exercise tolerance evaluation by questionnaires."
