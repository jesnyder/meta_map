      "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ponatinib in participants with metastatic and/or unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) following failure of prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy.",
      "DetailedDescription": "This is a non-randomized, open label, multi-center phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ponatinib in participants with metastatic and/or unresectable GIST after failure of prior TKI therapy. Participants whose tumors have an activating mutation in exon 11 of cellular KIT (KIT) will be enrolled into Cohort A. Participants whose tumors have other activating mutations will be enrolled into in Cohort B.\n\nThe primary objective is to assess clinical benefit in participants with KIT exon 11-mutant GIST (Cohort A) defined as clinical benefit rate (CBR), which is the composite of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) lasting greater than or equal to (>=) 16 weeks per modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST 1.1) as a measure of disease control. The secondary objective is to assess clinical benefit in participants with GIST that lacks an activating KIT exon 11 mutation (Cohort B) and in the total participant population. The efficacy assessments are tumor response using RECIST Version 1.1, modified for GIST and assessment of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The safety assessments include routine physical and laboratory evaluations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms (ECHOs), and adverse event (AE) monitoring. Other assessments include optional 18F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET); optional pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsy for pharmacodynamic studies; and pharmacokinetics (PK). It is estimated that accrual will be complete within 1 year; the total estimated duration of the study is 3 years."
