      "BriefSummary": "Utilizing the osteogenic properties of both platelet rich fibrin matrix and peripheral blood mesenchymal stem cells for periodontal regeneration would be novel and may be advantageous than using Platelet rich fibrin matrix alone. The literature search does not show any human clinical trial conducted till date to assess the regenerative potential of this new material i.e. Supercell glue (PRFM and PBMSCs).In this new material because of the addition of a patented gel the second spin to procure the PRFM has been eliminated and this seems to be an additional advantage. This study therefore aims at the evaluation of Supercell glue (PRFM and PBMSCs) as a regenerative material in comparison with PRFM alone in human mandibular periodontal intraosseous defects.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Periodontal regeneration involves the formation of alveolar bone, cementum and a new functional periodontal ligament. Over the recent years the concept of periodontal treatment has focused towards regeneration with a goal of regaining natural periodontal apparatus. Numerous procedures have been investigated in the past to try to promote periodontal regeneration which range from root biomodifications, soft tissue grafts, bone replacement grafts, guided tissue regeneration to the use of combinations of the same. However the success of these approaches are highly variable. As a consequence current research trends are inclined towards the principle of 'biological solutions for biological problem' and thus attempts are directed towards various approaches like tissue engineering, ERT (endogenous regenerative technology), application of biologics, cell based techniques, biomimetic nanoscaffold fabrication and others for periodontal regeneration. Of all known Polypeptide Growth Factors, Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) and Transforming Growth Factor β (TGF β) which are abundant in α granule of platelets are shown to exert a favourable effect on periodontal regeneration. Therefore use of platelet concentrates is a convenient approach to obtain autologous growth factors.\n\nPlatelet rich fibrin matrix (PRFM) is an autologous concentrated platelet-rich thrombin free fibrin matrix, prepared by two step centrifugation of blood. Platelets isolated, remain intact and retain their growth factor compliment. This allows a more effective, sustained release of growth factors to the wound site following PRFM application. During the second spin, a cross-linking of fibrin takes place, resulting in the formation of a dense fibrin matrix, within which a concentration of viable platelets can be found. Having an organized fibrin matrix at the start of healing accelerates the speed of vascular ingress into the wound compared to non-accelerated healing, which requires a longer time for fibrin formation and the development of vascularity. The earlier the vascularity is established, faster is the migration of the bone-forming cells at the wound site and initiation of bone formation. Therapeutic applications of platelet-rich products have led to improved bone regeneration.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a multipotent stromal cells with prominent regenerative functions. MSCs were first identified and isolated from bone marrow and then found in various tissues including umbilical cord, adipose tissue and peripheral blood. Among these sources peripheral blood MSCs draw increasing attention as they share similar biological characteristics with MSCs derived from bone marrow or adipose tissue. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells(BMMSCs) are multipotent cells capable of differentiating into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, fibroblasts, tenocytes, and myoblasts, which are considered as a cell source for various tissue repair and regenerating bone defects. The requirements of aspiration of bone marrow from the patient will cause pain and morbidity of the donor sites. It will be very convenient if peripheral blood mesenchymal stem cells (PBMSCs) could be harvested and expanded to enough numbers, with their osteogenic capacity maintained in a clinical permitted period.\n\nHence, utilizing the osteogenic properties of both platelet rich fibrin matrix and peripheral blood mesenchymal stem cells for periodontal regeneration would be novel and may be advantageous than using Platelet rich fibrin matrix alone. The literature search does not show any human clinical trial conducted till date to assess the regenerative potential of this new material i.e. Supercell glue (PRFM and PBMSCs).In this new material because of the addition of a patented gel the second spin to procure the PRFM has been eliminated and this seems to be an additional advantage. This study therefore aims at the evaluation of Supercell glue (PRFM and PBMSCs) as a regenerative material in comparison with PRFM alone in human mandibular periodontal intraosseous defects."
