      "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this phase I study is to test the safety of different dose levels of specially prepared cells collected called \"modified T cells\". In the screening part of this study the tumor was found to have a protein called MUC16. This protein is present on about 70% of ovarian cancers. The investigators want to find a safe dose of modified T cells for patients with this type of cancer that has progressed after standard chemotherapy. We also want to find out what effects these modified T cells have on the patient and their cancer.",
      "DetailedDescription": "There are 2 phases to the study: the Screening Phase and the Intervention Phase. Only patients identified as eligible from the Screening Phase may enroll in the Intervention Phase.\n\nScreening Phase: After signing Informed Consent 1 (Screening Informed Consent), the patient's MUC16ecto tumor expression will be determined as previously described. In order to be eligible for this protocol, the patient's ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube carcinoma must express the MUC16ecto protein detectable by IHC analysis of banked (paraffin embedded) or fresh biopsied tumor. After signing Informed Consent 1, approximately 2 weeks will elapse while the patient's banked tumor is tested for MUC16ecto expression. If a patient's tumor is found to express MUC16ecto, she will undergo leukapheresis for the collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), which will be frozen for future use. The leukapheresis product will be stored until the end of the study in case future research tests related to this study are developed.\n\nIntervention Phase: Patients must sign Informed Consent 2 (Intervention Informed Consent) before receiving treatment on the study before receiving treatment on the study.\n\nOnce the patient is eligible to receive the CAR+ T cells, the frozen leukapheresis product will be thawed and used to generate the 4H11-28z/fIL-12/EGFRt+ genetically-modified T cells. It is expected to take approximately 4-6 weeks to prepare the autologous CAR+ T cells.\n\nOn day 1-3 patients in cohorts V will receive conditioning chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m^2 or 300 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide concurrent with 25-30 mg/m2 fludarabine 2-7 days prior to the initial infusion of autologous CAR+T cells. Patients will receive autologous CAR+T cells in 2 infusions, the first IV and the second IP, each comprising about half the total dose. The IV infusion will be given first. The patient will then be closely monitored. One to 3 days later if clinically stable, the patient will receive the remaining dose of CAR+T cells IP. Patients in cohort I or -I will not receive cyclophosphamide, but will receive the T cells in the same manner (approximately half IV, followed by close monitoring and then 1-3 days later, if the patient is clinically stable, the remaining cells will be administered IP)."
