      "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of PSORI-CM01 formula vs Gu Ben Hua Yu formula combined with Expanded Allogeneic AD-MSCs in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. And it explores the expectations of patients for the treatment of traditional Chinese medicine combined with stem cells and their expectations to participate in this study. The trial would provide preliminary data for large sample clinical randomized controlled trials.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Psoriasis is an immune-mediated, genetic disease manifesting in the skin or joints or both. Treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease severity, relevant comorbidities, patient preference. For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy, systemic therapy and biologic immune modifying agents are recommended, but all of them have some drawbacks or limitations. Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to find new treatment for psoriasis.\n\nAs current experience and cases of AD-MSCs in the treatment of psoriasis are still relatively small, and it is unknown about their safety and efficacy combined with traditional medicine in the treatment of psoriasis.\n\nThis study designed a randomized controlled trial to compare PSORI-CM01 formula vs Guben Huayu formula combined with expanded allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of psoriasis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of PSORI-CM01 formula vs Gu Ben Hua Yu formula combined with Expanded Allogeneic AD-MSCs in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. And it also aims to determine the feasibility and the potential of the protocol for the full-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT).\n\nTherefore, 16 subjects will be enrolled in this study and their expectations for the treatment of traditional Chinese medicine combined with stem cells and their experience to participate in this study will be interviewed."
