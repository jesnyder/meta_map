      "DetailedDescription": "This is a treatment protocol to provide patients who have failed steroid treatment for acute GVHD expanded access of Prochymal. It is anticipated that a maximum of 10 patients per month for a total of 120 patients per year will be treated according to this protocol.\n\nPatients will be treated with Prochymal twice per week at a dose of 2 x 106 human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC)/kg (actual body weight) for each of 4 consecutive weeks. Infusions will be administered at least 3 days apart."
