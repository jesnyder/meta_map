      "DetailedDescription": "This is an Individual Patient Expanded Access IND with the primary goal of treatment for an individual with Parkinson's Disease. There are no FDA approved, fully restorative treatments for Parkinson's Disease. The subject will receive a total of twelve autologous HB-adMSCs infusion of 200 million cells.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\n1. To evaluate the efficacy of HB- adMSCs by improving activities of daily living in a subject with Parkinson's Disease.\n\nSecondary Objective:\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy of HB- adMSCs by improving quality-of-life in a subject with Parkinson's Disease.\nTo assess the safety of multiple administrations of HB-adMSCs in a subject with Parkinson's Disease\n\n7.3. Statistical Measures\n\nData analysis will be limited to descriptive statistics of the following:\n\nIncidence and severity of adverse events as measured by CBC, CMP, coagulation panel.\nC-reactive protein and Sedimentation rate will be measured to evaluate the ability of HBadMSCs to alter Parkinson's Disease related inflammation.\nChanges in brain and dopamine availability reflected in PET Scan results.\nChanges in motor function as measured by the UPDRS score.\nChanges in motor function as documented in video records\nChanges in function abilities as measured by the Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living score.\nChanges in quality-of-life scores as measured by the subject evaluations in the \"Social Roles and Activities\" surveys.\n\n7.4 Measurement Tools\n\nUPDRS\nNeuro-QOL Scale v1.0\nSchwab and England Activities of Daily Living score.\nVideo recordings\nWriting Samples\nModified Hoehn and Yahr Staging score\nSchwab and England Activities of Daily Living score."
