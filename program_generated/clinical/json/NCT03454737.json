      "DetailedDescription": "Main objective\n\nConfirm the presence of patellar tendon gap regeneration after the peritendinous and intratendinous infusion of MSV and compare it with the P-PRP group, evaluated by ECO, NMR and UTC.\nTo evaluate the clinical efficacy of infusion of MSC in refractory patellar tendinopathy compared with the P-PRP group through the subjective clinical evolution of the patient, the EVA and VISA-P questionnaires and the strength of the extensor muscle group measured by dynamometry.\nSecondary objective 1. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of the advanced therapy medication MSV and P-PRP when applied by percutaneous infusion into the body of the patellar tendinosis, verifying that each of the procedures established in the protocol is feasible and recording the possible adverse effects related with both treatments and adverse events arising during the period of the clinical trial, whether or not related to it"
