      "DetailedDescription": "In this study 18 subjects with mild to moderate symptomatic knee osteoarthritis will be recruited per an IRB approved protocol with explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects who are enrolled and meet all criteria will be blinded and randomized (2:1) to receive Platelet Rich Plasma or normal saline \"control\". Prior to the intervention, a synovial fluid aspiration will occur. At follow up number one (approximately 10 days from baseline) a repeat aspiration will occur and a differential analysis of the molecular and biochemical effects will be undertaken; this data will serve as the primary outcome measures. This data will be correlated to clinical and imaging outcome measures which will be secondary outcome measures completed at baseline and intermittently throughout the study. The duration of the study is one year."
