      "BriefSummary": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus is strictly autoimmune mediated disease destructing the islets β-cell of the pancreas. Mesenchymal stem cells and its microvesicles are reported as an anti-inflammatory agents. We hypothesis that intravenous infusion of cell free umbilical cord-blood derived MSC microvesicles may reduce the inflammatory state and hence improve the β-cell mass as well as the glycemic control of the patients of T1DM.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Twenty T1DM patients, age between 18-60 years with reduction of C-peptide chain more than 50%, C-peptide of more than 0.8 ng/mL at Screening and requiring insulin ≥0.4 IU per kg per day.\nTwenty T1DM patients of the same entry selection criteria will be subjected to all steps except the microvesicles administration as a control group.\nStudy follow up period: Three months\nGender: Both males and females are included\nEntry selection criteria include:\n\nUACR less than 300, BUN between 10-20 mg/dl, serum creatinin between 0.6-1.4 mg/dl and normal liver enzymes, normal serum bilirubin, normal serum albumin and coagulation profile). C-peptide of more than 0.8 ng/mL at Screening. BMI 20-40 kgm/m2 - Exclusion criteria: Other autoimmune diseases. Pregnancy. Previous treatment with stem cells. All patients and controls will be investigated for HBV, HCV & HIV by PCR test before enrollment in the study and positivity for any of these parameters means exclusion of this patient from the study.\n\n- The primary end point will be the end of three months follow up. At day (0):All patients and controls will be subjected to the following investigations: Liver functions tests, kidney functions tests, HbA1c, glucose tolerance test (GTT), fasting and 2 hrs.post prandial blood glucose levels, C-peptide chain level and calculated total daily insulin dose.\n\nAfter three months (at the end of the study) the same investigations will be repeated.\n\nTwo intravenous infusions of cell free cord-blood derived mesenchymal stem cells [CB-MSC] microvesicles:\n\n- The first dose will be purified exosomes, ranging between 40-180 nm, in a dose of the supernatant produced from (1.22-1.51) × 10 (6)/kg/IV.\n\n(Characterization of exosomes:CD63, CD9, Alix, TSG 101, HSP 70).\n\n- The second dose, after 7 days, will be the microvesicles, ranging between 180-1000 nm, in a dose of the supernatant produced from (1.22-1.51) × 10 (6)/kg/IV.\n\n(Characterization of microvesicles: (Annexin V, Flotillin-2, selectin,integrin, CD40 metalloproteinase)."
