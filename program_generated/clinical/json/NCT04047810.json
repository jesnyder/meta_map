An acute exacerbation of COPD is defined as a respiratory event requiring the use of antibiotics or systemic steroids or both.\nInformed consent form (ICF): Each patient will be required to sign an IRB approved ICF. Only subjects who have signed the ICF will be enrolled into the study. The ICF will include elements required by Mayo IRB and FDA in US 21CFR50.\nSubject must have a calculated creatinine clearance of greater than 30 ml/min.\nSubject must be available for all specified assessments at the study site through the completion of the study.\nSubject must provide written ICF and authorization for use of and disclosure of PHI.\nSubjects must have oxyhemoglobin saturation on room air at rest equal or greater than 88%.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nPatients with clinically significant illness with manifestations of significant organ dysfunction which in the judgment of the PI or co-investigator would render the study subject unlikely to tolerate the MSC infusion or complete the study\nSubject has been diagnosed with a pulmonary disease other than COPD (e.g. asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, pulmonary hypertension, bronchiolitis, interstitial lung disease)\nSubject has been diagnosed with α1-Antitrypsin deficiency\nSubject has a body mass index greater than 35 or less than 16\nSubject has or has had an active infection requiring systemic antibiotics within 12 weeks on enrollment in the study\nSubject has had exacerbation of COPD requiring hospitalization within 12 weeks of enrollment in the study.\nSubject has initiated pulmonary rehabilitation within 12 weeks of enrollment in the study\nSubject uses or used prednisone (or equivalent dose of another corticosteroid) within 12 weeks of enrollment in the study\nSubject has evidence or history of malignancy\nSubject has evidence or history of autoimmune disorders independent of COPD\nSubject is pregnant or breast-feeding\nSubject has a history of HIV, Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C\nSubject has evidence of liver dysfunction manifested as alkaline phosphatase greater than 345 u/L, total bilirubin greater than 1.65 mg/dL, ALT greater than 275 units/L and/or AST great than 240 units/L.\nSubject has evidence of significant cardiac dysfunction, e.g. acute myocardial infarction within 3 months of screening, patients with the diagnosis of unstable angina. Patients with the diagnosis of \"Cor pulmonale\", uncontrolled tachyarrhythmia or bradyarrhythmia, atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, history of insertion of pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, patient with clinical diagnose of heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction and patients with a history of congenital heart disease.\nSubjects with pulmonary lobectomy or lung volume reduction surgery or lung transplantation.\nSubjects with clinically significant bronchiectasis.\nSubject received an experimental therapy (drug or biologic) for any indication within 12 months of the study enrollment\nSubject is unable to complete all the testing required for the study\nSubjects who are on immunosuppressive medications.",
