A specific attention will be paid on the presence/persistence of skin Trm and ILCs.\n\nThe study population will consist of 20 adult patients suffering from moderate to severe Atopic Dermatitis and eligible for Dupilumab treatment. (Patients should have inadequate response, intolerance or contraindication to systemic anti-inflammatory treatments).\n\nThis is an exploratory, prospective, single-site, randomized, open labeled study. There is a treatment period of 168 days (24 weeks) and a post-treatment follow-up period of maximum 102 days."
