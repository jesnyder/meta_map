      "BriefSummary": "Heart failure is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Currently drug treatments for heart failure manage the symptoms, but not restore the loss cardiomyocytes due to the very limited regenerative capability in the adult heart. Novel reparative therapies that replace the cardiomyocytes loss are highly demanded to restore the cardiac function. The main purposes of this explanatory study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of the catheter-based endocardial delivery of human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes in patients with congestive heart failure.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Patients with severe congestive heart failure will be treated with allogeneic human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (HiCM-188) through the catheter-based injections. HiCM188, produced by Help therapeutics with cGMP condition, will be transplanted into the myocardium through a transcatheter endocardial injection system with two dosage (100 million cells or 400 million cells). The safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted at1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the cell transplantation."
