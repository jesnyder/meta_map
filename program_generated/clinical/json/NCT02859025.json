      "BriefSummary": "Our aim was to combine regenerative techniques with bone grafting in human models to increase predictability and survival of reconstructed tissue. The MSCs in this study were derived from an intra oral fat source (BFP) and were cultured over natural bovine bone mineral granules and delivered within the lateral ramus cortical bone plate (LRCP)to treat human alveolar cleft defects.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Patients enrolled in the present study were suffering from alveolar cleft and had previously received orthodontic treatment and only required secondary alveolar grafting. The buccal fat pad derived stem cells (BFPSCs) were harvested from buccal fat pad tissues of the patients. Patients were divided into 3 groups. Group A , the control group, was treated with anterior iliac crest (AIC) spongy bone to fill defects, followed by coverage with collagen membrane. Group B was treated with lateral ramus cortical bone cage (LRCP), used to create a protected healing space by fixing it to adjacent walls of the cleft defect. Group C was treated with (AIC) as in Group 1, but BFP-derived MSCs cultured over NBBM were put over the spongy bone and covered with a collagen membrane.Passage 3 BFPSCs were loaded on the implants ( Cerabone (Botiss, Berlin, Germany) a natural bovine bone mineral (NBBM); a granular biomaterial with a 200- to 850-Âµm particle size) 3 days prior to transplantation.Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) was obtained after 6 months."
