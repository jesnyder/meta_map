      "BriefSummary": "This clinical study evaluates the efficacy of the autologous blood-derived product called platelet- and extracellular vesicle-rich plasma (PVRP) for the treatment of chronically inflamed post-surgical temporal bone cavities. Half of the participants will be treated with platelet- and extracellular vesicle-rich plasma and another half with standard nonsurgical measures.",
      "DetailedDescription": "The hypothesis of this study is that platelet- and extracellular vesicle-rich plasma (PVRP) may be efficient in the treatment of chronically inflamed post-surgical temporal bone cavities.\n\nPlatelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a well-known autologous blood-derived product with favourable immune, haemostatic and regenerative effects. It has been used in various medical fields including otorhinolaryngology.\n\nIn fact, PRP contains important concentrations of extracellular vesicles (EV) which are the main contributors to PRP effects. For that reason, PRP can be identified as platelet- and extracellular vesicle-rich plasma (PVRP). In this study, PVRP will be prepared by a unique non-commercial 2-step centrifugation protocol developed by this study researchers.\n\nA radical cavity is a large post-surgical temporal bone cavity due to removal of the posterior external ear canal wall in open-technique cholesteatoma surgery. This technique is performed in approximately 40 per cent of cholesteatoma surgery.\n\nRadical cavities become inflamed in 3-20 per cent, which leads to the formation of granulation tissue and multiple suppurative periods. The large spectrum of surgical and nonsurgical treatment options have been applied to reduce patient discomfort. This significantly worsens the patients' quality of life and puts a significant burden on health care.\n\nDue to the knowledge of local immune response mechanisms in moist radical cavities and exhausted treatment options, new conservative treatment options have been researched. PVRP could present a promising treatment option for chronically inflamed radical cavities based on published preclinical and clinical studies.\n\nPVRP will be administered to chronically inflamed radical cavities via PVRP-soaked ear wicks."
