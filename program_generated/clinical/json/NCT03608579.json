Subjects will receive either a single dose of 30 million autologous culture-expanded adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AMSCs), or two doses of AMSCs (with one month interval between doses) via ultrasound guided intra-articular hip injection. Patients will be followed for 24 months past their last injection to determine the local and systemic safety of single and two-dose injections of AMSCs in the treatment of symptomatic hip OA."

Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at a central clinical laboratory, whereas urine pregnancy tests will be performed by qualified personnel using kit\n\nPersons becoming pregnant during the study will continue to be monitored for the duration of the study or completion of the pregnancy, whichever is longer.

the target hip within 3 months prior to study enrollment\nLocking, catching, give-away or another major mechanical symptoms of the target hip\nHistory of intra-articular infection in the target hip\nHistory of superficial infection in the target hip within 6 months of study enrollment, or evidence of current superficial infection affecting the target hip\nHistory of falls requiring medical attention, or gait instability\nClinically significant abnormal hematology (complete blood count with differential), blood chemistry, or urinalysis screening laboratory results.\nBody mass index (BMI) > 35 kg/m2\nTaking anticoagulant medications (e.g. warfarin, heparin or clopidogrel) which may pose a clinically-significant contraindication to intra-articular injection.\nTaking herbal therapies or

limited to chondroitin sulfate, diacerein, n-glucosamine and capsaicin)\nTaking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (e.g. COX-2 inhibitors) without a stable dosing regimen for at least 4 weeks

unless there is a stable regimen for at least 4 weeks before baseline assessment\nTaking anti-rheumatic disease medication (including methotrexate or other antimetabolites) within 3 months prior to study enrollment\nOn chronic, immunosuppressive transplant therapy or having a chronic, immunosuppressive state, including use of systemic steroids/corticosteroids\nCurrent tobacco product use, including nicotine patch or other nicotine products\nClinically significant systemic inflammatory, rheumatological or connective tissue disorder including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, system lupus erythematosus, and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome\nClinically significant rheumatological or inflammatory disease of the hip or chondrocalcinosis/calcium pyrophosphate disease (CPPD), hemochromatosis, inflammatory arthritis, arthropathy of the hip associated with juxta-articular Paget's disease of the femur or pelvis, ochronosis, hemophilic arthropathy, infectious arthritis, Charcot's hip joint, villonodular synovitis, and synovial chondromatosis\nOngoing infectious disease, including but not limited to tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis, and syphilis\nClinically significant cardiovascular (e.g. history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension > 90 mmHg diastolic and/or 180 mmHg systolic), neurologic (e.g. stroke, TIA) renal, hepatic, orthopedic (e.g. surgery on other weight bearing joints that will interfere with study, osteoporosis, acute lower body fractures), or endocrine disease (e.g. diabetes).\nVascular or neurological disorder affecting the either lower limb which poses clinical significance to the safe delivery of intra-articular therapy.\nHistory of cancer/malignancy with the exception of adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin not associated with the target hip\nHistory of clinically significant blood dyscrasia, including but not limited to anemia, thrombocytopenia, and monoclonal gammopathy\nParticipation in a study of an experimental drug or medical device within 3 months of study enrollment\nKnown allergy to local anesthetics of other components of the study drug\nAny contraindication to MRI scan according to MRI guidelines, or unwillingness to undergo MRI procedures\nHistory of or current evidence of alcohol or drug abuse or dependence, recreational use of illicit drug or prescription medications, or have use of medical marijuana within 30 days of study entry\nAny illness or condition which, in the investigators' judgement will interfere with the
