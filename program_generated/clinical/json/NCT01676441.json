The results revealed the safety of autologous MSC. This Phase II, III single-center trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell transplantation direct to injured spinal cord site via laminectomy. After recovery from the operation, the subjects receive 4 weeks of physical and occupational therapy."
