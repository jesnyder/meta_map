      "BriefSummary": "The study aims to investigate the effect of a long-term combined aerobic exercise and cognitive training program on cognitive function and blood exosomal synaptic protein levels in seniors at increased risk for Alzheimer's Disease.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in people older than 65 years worldwide. The neuropathological changes of AD occur decades before the onset of cognitive impairment, suggesting that early identification and timely intervention may postpone the clinical progress. In addition to its characteristic amyloid Î² and tau pathology, AD is also marked by synaptic dysfunction. Abnormal synaptic protein levels, such as growth associated protein 43 (GAP43), neurogranin, synaptotagmins, and synaptosome associated protein 25 (SNAP25) have been observed in the brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Blood neuro-exosomal synaptic proteins have emerged as promising predictors for AD and cognitive decline. Particularly, we previously reported a combination of blood neuro-exosomal protein (GAP43, neurogranin, SNAP25, and synaptotagmin 1) can predict AD 5 to 7 years before the clinical onset.\n\nBoth physical exercise and cognitive training have been demonstrated to improve cognitive function in AD and to exert a protective effect against developing dementia in the normal aging population. Furthermore, cognitive stimulation is an established modulator of synaptic plasticity and physical exercise might regulate synapse functional and structural change. However, whether cognitive training and physical exercise can alter exosomal synaptic protein levels and the relationship of biomarker changes to cognitive function in those seniors at increased risk for AD remain unclear.\n\nIn this study, we aim to\n\nassess the effects of a long-term combined aerobic exercise and cognitive training program on cognitive function and the predictive biomarkers (blood neuro-exosomal synaptic proteins: GAP43, neurogranin, SNAP25, and synaptotagmin 1) in seniors at increased risk of AD with abnormally decreased levels of the biomarkers.\ndetermine the relationship of biomarker changes with cognitive function in these people.\nconfirm the predictive value of the blood neuro-exosomal synaptic proteins for AD in a longitudinal setting."
