      "BriefSummary": "Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), mindfulness-based cancer recovery (MBCR), have been showing promising results in different health-related and psychosocial outcomes in the context of cancer. More recently, the possibility of delivering MBIs using technological tools and resources, such as internet and applications, has been receiving much attention, also accompanied by promising findings. However, few randomized controlled studies have been conducted and published to date. Moreover, few studies have addressed the long-term stability and trajectory of gains across time. Also, even though prior evidence had suggested that face-to-face MBIs might modulate several biological markers (e.g., pro-inflammatory gene expression and inflammatory signaling; telomere length), as far as we know, no previous study addressed the impact of online MBIs on biological indices, especially on extracellular vesicles (EVs).\n\nAs primary objective, this study aims to investigate the effects of an internet-based MBCT intervention (vs. Treatment as Usual - TAU) on EVs (objective measure), as well as on psychological distress (subjective measure), considering a sample of distressed people with history of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer.\n\nAs secondary objective, this study aims to investigate the effects of this same intervention on psychosocial outcomes, including quality of life, fear of cancer recurrence, emotion suppression, mindfulness, sleep quality, posttraumatic growth, health-related behaviours (physical activity; smoking habits), and perceived social support. The biological secondary outcomes studied will be: inflammatory response genes interleukins (ILs, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10), interferon gamma (IFN-Î³), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), and c-reactive protein (CRP); telomerase activity; antigens related to cancer (cancer antigen - CA 15-3; prostate-specific antigen - PSA; carcinoembryonic antigen - CEA); other health-related markers (adrenocorticotropic hormone - ACTH; erythrocytes number; hemoglobin glycosylated)."

Mindfulness practices include breath awareness, sitting and walking meditations, and mindful yoga. In this study, the following MBCT structure will be followed: group setting of 12 participants (maximum); 8 online weekly meetings of 2 hours via a videoconference platform (e.g., Cisco Webex), each one mediated by a trained mindfulness instructor(s); daily home practice of the learned skills; 2 hours of retreat after the fifth week; 6 months of home practice; 4 monthly consolidation sessions of 90 minutes each.",
