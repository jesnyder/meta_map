      "BriefSummary": "Nasal trauma, deviated nasal septum, sinusitis, nasal polyps and other nasal benign diseases are common clinical diseases and require endoscopic sinus surgery. The proper application of the surgical procedure as well as ensuring high quality of wound healing, is also important to achieve successful results in endoscopic sinus surgery. If good quality wound healing cannot be achieved in the surgical field,synechiae and anatomic defects can occur that may require revision surgeries.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells play an active role in the treatment of many diseases. it primarily exerts therapeutic effects through paracrine. In this study, the effect of mesenchymal stem cell-derived multipotent factors on mucosal repair after nasal surgery was evaluated."
