      "DetailedDescription": "Infertility is defined as a women fails to become pregnant after having a normal sex life for two years without contraception. There is limited treatment to the infertility caused by severe IUA especially recurrent IUA after adhesiolysis which hinders embryos implantation. The existing drugs, physical or surgical treatments had no significant effects to severe recurrent intrauterine adhesions. Collagen is the main component of the extracellular matrix with good biocompatibility, UC-MSCs have been used in the clinical treatment of diseases, and achieved good results. In this study, collagen scaffold and umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells are combined, and they showed good biological safety."

And after that there will be history taking, physical examination, ultrasound examination and hysteroscopy examination. If they agree to participate, they will receive separation of adhesions by hysteroscopy surgery and endometrial biopsies, then a collagen scaffold loaded with UC-MSCs will be transplanted into the uterine cavity. The procedure was performed after taking 6 mg/day Ã— 10 days Progynova, continuous administration of the same dosage Progynova for 30 days and 60mg of progesterone were injected on the 30th day post-operation. Postoperative observation including ultrasound examination once a month for 3 times and hysteroscopy after 3 months. The doctor will select an appropriate time for pregnancy and follow-up including requiring patients to do some unscheduled visits.",
