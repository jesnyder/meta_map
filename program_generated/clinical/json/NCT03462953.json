      "BriefSummary": "The current study focuses on the localization and quantitative assessment of growth factors and cytokines related to the EMT process found in the human gingival tissue samples taken from periodontally diseased individuals compared to other samples taken from healthy individuals. Through this investigation the correlation between the severity of the disease and the amount of these factors will be studied aiming to alleviation of the high prevalence of periodontal diseases among the Egyptian population.",
      "DetailedDescription": "In a case control human study The existence and the amount of the indicators and cytokines for EMT in the gingival tissue samples taken from the periodontitis patients will be investigated and compared to those in healthy individuals using histopathology and real time PCR to reveal the role of these factors in periodontal disease incidence in humans.\n\nTotal of 36 participants will be recruited in this study The participants will be divided according to their periodontal status into four groups (healthy, mild, moderate and severe periodontitis) 9 patients in each group.\n\nThe periodontal screening of patients will be done using mouth mirror and graduated Williams's periodontal probe for the following:\n\nGingival status will be assessed by using gingival index\nPeriodontal pocket depth.\nClinical attachment loss.\nRadiographic examination using panoramic technique. Screening criteria for chronic periodontitis was the presence of at least 5 sites with 4 mm horizontal alveolar bone loss on radiographs.\n\nGingival tissue samples will be harvested during periodontal surgery and extraction of the periodontally hopeless tooth for the periodontitis patients and during the premolar extraction (Orthodontic ttt) or third molar extraction for the healthy controls.\n\nThe dissected gingival samples will be washed in saline solution and fixed in 4% buffered formalin for 48 hours, dehydrated in ascending grades of ethyl alcohol, cleared in xylene and embedded in paraffin and will be subjected to the following:.\n\nSections of 4-5 µm in thickness will be obtained, deparaffinized, rehydrated and subjected to histological staining and histomorphometric analysis.\nReal time- PCR for TGF-B1 ,Vimenten , E-Cadherin ."
