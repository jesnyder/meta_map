Each time a clinical evaluation by Harris Hip Score (HHS) was carried out by the same orthopedic surgeon. Radiological controls (pelvis and hip affected) were performed at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and then every year.\n\nThe primary outcome evaluated was the avoiding or delaying of total hip replacement (THR), while the secondary outcomes were the assessment of any change in clinical performance as measured by Harris Hip Score"
