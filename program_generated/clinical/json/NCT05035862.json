      "BriefSummary": "This study is a two strata, dose escalation Phase I clinical trial designed to assess the safety and determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of allogenic cord tissue derived MSCs (cMSCs, stratum 1) and allogeneic, interferon-γ primed bone marrow MSCs (γMSCs, stratum 2). Each stratum is designed to independently accrue 3 children at a dose level 1 of 2x106 cells/kg and 6 children at dose level 2 of 10x106 cells/kg, resulting in 9 children in each stratum. The primary objectives are to determine the safety and toxicity of allogeneic cord tissue derived MSCs and allogeneic interferon-γ primed bone marrow derived MSCs.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Asthma affects one out of every 10 patients in the United States. Many of these patients have poor asthma symptom control. For example, patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma have ongoing symptoms and airway inflammation despite aggressive treatment with asthma medications. These patients are at increased risk for medication-related side effects and potentially life-threatening exacerbations. Novel therapies are critically needed for this population.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are cells that reside in the bone marrow. MSCs are anti-inflammatory and also promote body tissue repair. This study will determine whether one form of MSCs called \"interferon gamma-primed MSCs or γMSCs\" are safe for patients with moderate-to-severe asthma.\n\nPatients will receive a single intravenous infusion of γMSCs at either 2x10^6 cells/kg or 5x10^6 cells/kg. Up to 12 young adults will be enrolled. The total sample size will not exceed 24 participants.\n\nThe study will take place at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (for patient activities) and at Emory University (for laboratory research activities). Participants will be identified from the asthma clinics at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. Participants will complete up to 12 visits over 1 year and will be compensated for their time and travel. At the completion of the study, any samples remaining after experimentation will be de-identified and made available for future research.\n\nWhile some study participants may receive no direct benefit from participating in this study, others may benefit from the close monitoring of their respiratory health, specialized asthma education, and general evaluation of their condition, including lung function tests. Some participants also achieve psychological benefit from participating in an important research study and from interaction with the study staff. It is also possible that the knowledge obtained from this study, such as identification of biomarkers, may assist in the creation of novel asthma therapies in the future."
