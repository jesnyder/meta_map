      "BriefSummary": "Skin grafting is a standard treatment for deep wounds, but care of the donor site after transplantation is very important. The means of accelerating wound healing can increase overall patient satisfaction. In recent years, cytokine therapy has been an important strategy to promote tissue repair.Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been considered the star cells that promote tissue repair. It works mainly through paracrine. Many biological effectors, including IGF-1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), TGF-β1, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), have been found and reported in various MSC conditioned media (MSC-CM), And play a role in promoting tissue repair and regeneration. In here, we aim to explore the MSC-CM-derived pleiotropic factor in treating donor sites and further evaluate its safety and effectiveness"
