      "BriefSummary": "This randomized pilot phase I trial studies the side effects and best method of delivery of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in improving heart function in patients with heart failure caused by anthracyclines (a type of chemotherapy drug used in cancer treatment). MSCs are a type of stem cell that can be removed from bone marrow and grown into many different cell types that can be used to treat cancer and other diseases, such as heart failure. Bone marrow derived MSCs may promote heart muscle cells repair and lead to reverse remodeling and ultimately improve heart function and decrease morbidity and mortality from progression to advanced heart failure.",
      "DetailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To demonstrate the safety of allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) administered by intravenous infusion in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and heart failure secondary to chemotherapy with anthracyclines.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To demonstrate the efficacy of allogeneic hMSCs administered by intravenous infusion in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] < 40%) and heart failure secondary to treatment with anthracyclines.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive allogeneic hMSCs intravenously (IV) over 10-20 minutes once weekly for 4 weeks and standard of care drugs for heart failure.\n\nARM II: Patients receive only standard of care drugs for heart failure.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 6 months and then at 12 months."
