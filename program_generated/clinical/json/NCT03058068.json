      "BriefSummary": "A Safety Run-In will be followed by a Double-Blinded Randomized Phase. All subjects shall meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and will be evaluated prior to the scheduled infusion to establish baseline.\n\nThere will be 3 subjects in the safety run-in phase and 15 subjects in the double-blinded phase.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Primary objective is to demonstrate the safety of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) intravenously administered to subjects with cystic fibrosis.\n\nSecondary Objective is to explore if MSCs can improve the symptoms of cystic fibrosis, including lung function, the rate of pulmonary exacerbation, systemic and local inflammation and symptom-related quality of life.\n\nThe Safety Run-In will be performed to evaluate the safety of MSC infusion into subjects with cystic fibrosis. 3 subjects will participate and they will receive a single administration of allogeneic MSCs given through intravenous infusion.\n\nIn the randomized phase the subjects will be randomized at a ratio of 1:1:1 into 3 cohorts to receive infusions. There will be a total of 15 subjects in 3 cohorts.\n\nThe total duration for each subject after infusion is 12 months, plus up to an additional 2 months for the Screening and Baseline Visits. Approximately 9 visits in total."
