      "BriefSummary": "Mandible fractures are a common cause of facial injury in adults. The autologous mesenchymal stem cell (AMSC) transplantation, is proposed as an alternative to the conventional graft treatment, improving bone neoformation.The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of AMSCs application in mandibular fractures to reduce regeneration time and increase bone quality.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Single blinded controlled clinical trial in patients with mandibular angle fracture. The patients were divided into: Study Group (SG): fracture reduction plus application of AMSCs, Control Group (CG): Same procedure without AMSCs. AMSCs were obtained from adipose tissue , 24 hrs before the procedure. Intensity and density were evaluated in normal bone and fractured bone, at 4 and 12 weeks after surgery using panoramic radiography and computed tomography. (CT)\n\nA total of 20 patients, 10 in each group were included. SG with a mean age of 31.2 ± 6.3 years and CG 29.7 ± 7.2 years, all patients were male. Bone quality at week 4 SG 108.82 ± 3.4 vs CG 93.92 ± 2.6 (p = 0.000) by panoramic radiography, SG 123 ± 4.53 vs CG 99.72 ± 5.72 (p = 0.000) by CT. At week 12: SG 153.53±1.83 vs CG 101.81±4.83 (p= 0.000) by panoramic radiography, SG 165.4 ± 4.2 vs CG 112.05±2.1 (p= 0.000) by CT.\n\nThe application of AMSCs presented at week 4 similar ossification values compared with normal bone and a 36.48 % higher ossification rate at week 12."
