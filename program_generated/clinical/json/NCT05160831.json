      "BriefSummary": "This study aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell injection in the articular cavity to treat moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis (OA), and whether it can achieve articular cartilage regeneration, reduction of joint pain, and restoration of joint function.",
      "DetailedDescription": "There are more than 100 types of arthritis, and the most common ones are rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). The main cause of its pathogenesis is the compensatory hyperplasia of the articular cartilage caused by the body's degenerative changes, which will eventually cause the joint to partially or completely lose its function.\n\nIn the past few decades, continuous efforts have been made to treat OA. The treatment of OA changes with the development of the patient's condition. At present, there are many diagnosis and treatment options for knee OA, including conservative treatment and surgical treatment. There is an urgent need for an effective treatment to postpone or terminate the course of OA.\n\nCell therapy for OA has developed rapidly in recent years and has received widespread attention. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells with potential of self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation. Stem cells are extracted from the patient's body and then implanted back. Their ability of regeneration and reproduction can fill the damaged cartilage tissue, so as to achieve an effective treatment of the joint damage.\n\nThis study aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell injection in the articular cavity to treat moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis (OA), and whether it can achieve articular cartilage regeneration, reduction of joint pain, and restoration of joint function."
