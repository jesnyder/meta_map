Group I included ten intrabony posterior defect received beta tri calcium phosphate (β TCP) bone substitute. Group II included ten posterior intrabony periodontal defect and they received a mixture of gingival fibroblast(GF) and gingival mesenchymal stem cells(GMSCs) carried on a vehicle of β TCP covered by a resorbable collagen membrane. CBCT was used preoperatively and after 6 months for hard tissue evaluation. PDGF and BMP were measured in GCF at days 1,3,7,14."
