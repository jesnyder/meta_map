      "BriefSummary": "RATIONALE: Vaccines made from gene-modified tumor cells may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of tumor cells. Combining vaccine therapy with cyclophosphamide and interferon alfa may kill more tumor cells.\n\nPURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining vaccine therapy with interferon alfa and cyclophosphamide in treating patients who have stage IV breast cancer.",
      "DetailedDescription": "OBJECTIVES:\n\nDetermine the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of vaccine therapy comprising an allogeneic (non-self) tumor cell line transfected with the sargramostim (GM-CSF) gene combined with low-dose interferon alfa and low-dose cyclophosphamide in patients with stage IV breast cancer or other solid tumors.\nDetermine the clinical response, time to progression, and survival of patients treated with this regimen.\nCorrelate clinical response with immunological response in patients treated with this regimen.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients receive low-dose cyclophosphamide IV once 2-3 days before each tumor vaccine. Patients then receive tumor vaccine comprising HER2/neu-positive allogeneic (non-self) breast cancer cells transfected with the sargramostim (GM-CSF) gene intradermally (ID) on day 1. Patients also receive low-dose interferon alfa ID approximately 48 and 96 hours after each tumor vaccine. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 3 vaccinations and then monthly for 3 vaccinations in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPatients are followed at 2 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-24 patients will be accrued for this study."
