      "BriefSummary": "This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 3-way crossover phase I study being conducted on healthy volunteers to investigate the effect of single dose of AZD6094 (600 mg) on cardiac repolarization under well-controlled conditions in accordance with the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) E14 guidelines. An open-label Moxifloxacin (400 mg), a fluoroquinolone broad spectrum antibiotic will be used as a appositive control for the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave (QT) prolongation in accordance with ICH E14 guidelines, to establish assay sensitivity. The core study consists of screening period, 3 treatment period (AZD6094, placebo and moxifloxacin; with a minimum washout period of 14 days between each treatment period) and follow-up. The study drugs will be administered orally. The study is planned to determine effect of AZD6094 at therapeutic dose, safety and tolerability. This study provides adequate and well-controlled mechanisms to deal with potential bias, facilitate identification of effects related to investigational product (IMP) administration and tolerability issues.",
      "DetailedDescription": "The study is planned to include approximately 45 healthy non-Japanese vasectomized male participants aged 18 to 55 years (inclusive) or male participants over 40 (and up to 55) years old not intending to father children will be enrolled. The study consists of 5 visits comprised of 3 treatment periods with 6 treatment sequences and will have a minimum washout period of 14 days between each treatment period.\n\nVisit 1: Screening period (28 days) - Assessments done on Day -1 of treatment period 1.\n\nVisits 2 to 4: 3 Treatment periods - Participants will be resident form day before IMP (single oral dose of AZD6094 (600 mg) tablet/AZD6094 matching placebo/moxifloxacin (400 mg) capsule) dosing (Day -1) until at least 48 hours post-dose and will be discharged on Day 3.\n\nVisit 5: Follow-up - Participants will have clinical visit 14 days after discharge from the treatment period 3.\n\nParticipants will be randomized to 6 treatment sequences (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB and CBA). In each sequence, participants will receive single oral dose of all 3 treatments (A - AZD6094 600 mg (3X 200 mg tablet), B - Placebo tablet, C - Moxifloxacin 400 mg capsule) with a washout period (14 days) between each treatment period.\n\nThe study duration will be approximately 84 days."

No medications known to prolong the QT/QTc interval are allowed.\nPositive screen for drugs of abuse, cotinine (nicotine) and/or alcohol at Screening and before each admission to the Clinical Unit.\nHistory of severe allergy/hypersensitivity (including allergy to fluoroquinolone antibiotics) or ongoing clinically important allergy/hypersensitivity, as judged by the Investigator.\nHistory of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing clinically important allergy/hypersensitivity, as judged by the Investigator or history of hypersensitivity to drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to AZD6094.\nPlasma donation within one month of Screening or any blood donation/blood loss > 500 mL during the 3 months prior to Screening.\nHas received another new chemical entity (defined as a compound which has not been approved for marketing) within 3 months of the first administration of investigational product in this study. The period of exclusion begins 3 months after the final dose or one month after the last visit whichever is the longest. Note: participants consented and screened, but not randomized in this study or a previous Phase I study, are not excluded.\nInvolvement of any Astra Zeneca or study site employee or their close relatives.\nJudgment by the Investigator that the subject should not participate in the study if they have any ongoing or recent (i.e., during the screening period) minor medical complaints that may interfere with the interpretation of study data or are considered unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements.\nParticipants who are vegans, vegetarians or have medical dietary restrictions.\nParticipants who cannot communicate reliably with the Investigator.\n\nVulnerable participants, e.g., kept in detention, protected adults under guardianship, trusteeship, or committed to an institution by governmental or juridical order.\n\nIn addition, any of the following is regarded as a criterion for exclusion from the genetic research:\n\nPrevious bone marrow transplant.\nNon-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusion within 120 days of the date of the genetic sample collection.",
