      "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to improve fusion (bony healing) techniques and improve patient recovery by identifying cells in your body that make bone. Patients with spine problems often need surgeries that include fusion (bony healing) of vertebrae (bones in your back) together in order to hold the bones steady allowing them to heal together (fusion). If the vertebrae (back bones) fail to heal together, which occurs about 10-15% of the time, it can result in a slower recovery and may require revision (another) surgery. By using a small portion of the graft taken during surgery the investigators hope to define the cells that make bone most efficiently. This will help reduce the need for revision surgeries and improve patient recovery.",
      "DetailedDescription": "This study requests using your additional bone tissue (the extra tissue not needed after your back surgery is complete).\n\nThis tissue will be measured for total volume (amount), labeled with your age, gender, date and time the tissue was removed (date and time of surgery), and taken to a lab for analysis. You will not be billed for the collection of your additional tissue or the lab analysis. All routine procedures (surgery and all follow-up care relating to your back surgery) will still be paid for by you or your insurance.\n\nOnce your extra tissue sample has been collected, measured, labeled, and sent to the lab for testing, no further participation is required from you in this research study. The investigators will use your sample in our research to enhance bone healing."
