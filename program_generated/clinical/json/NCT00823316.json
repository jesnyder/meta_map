      "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PROMOSTEM (human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells) at a dose of 1 and 5x1,000,000 hMSC/kg in subject for the promotion of an engraftment and prevention of graft rejection and Graft-Versus-Host Disease after unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for children with acute leukemia.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a procedure in which progenitor cells capable of reconstituting normal bone marrow function are administered to a patient. This procedure has been used to treat adults and children with life-threatening hematological malignancies and congenital immunodeficiency disorders.\nIn HSCT, therapeutic goal is an elimination of disease and enrichment of regenerating capacity to achieve engraftments resulting in continued generation of functional blood elements from the engrafted living cells. Transplantation of unrelated hematopoietic stem cells originating either from adult bone marrow or from peripheral blood often leads to graft-versus host-disease (GvHD), opportunistic infections and graft failure after transplantation.\nIn HSCT, MSC have been used as a therapy for GvHD and other complications. The aim of MSC infusions in HSCT is to use the cells' immunomodulatory effects to promote engraftment and to reduce the immunological reactions giving rise to GvHD.\nThere is a growing interest in co-transplantation of MSC and HSC to improve the donor outcome in the unrelated HSCT condition."
