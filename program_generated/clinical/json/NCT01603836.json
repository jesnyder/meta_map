      "BriefSummary": "The use of autologous mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) in form of the BMC in combination with allograft is an effective option how to enhance the Posterolateral Fusion (PLF) healing. Allograft by itself is not an effective material as a posterior onlay graft for the PLF in adult surgery.",
      "DetailedDescription": "The study was prospective, randomized, controlled and blinded. Eighty patients with degenerative disease of the lumbar spine underwent instrumented lumbar or lumbosacral PLF. In forty cases, the PLF was done with spongious allograft chips alone (Group I). In another forty cases, spongious allograft chips were mixed with BMC (Group II), where the mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) concentration was 1.74 x104/L at average (range, 1.06-1.98 x104/L). Patients were scheduled for anteroposterior and lateral radiographs at 12 and 24 months after the surgery and for CT scanning at 24 months after the surgery. Fusion status and the degree of mineralization of the fusion mass were evaluated separately by two radiologists blinded to patient group affiliation."
