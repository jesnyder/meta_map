      "DetailedDescription": "This is a phase 2, two-cohort, single-arm open-label study that will assess the efficacy of AMG 337 based on ORR in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that overexpress MET or harbor METex14del mutations resulting in MET exon 14 skipping. MET overexpression will be determined by quantitative proteomics with mass spectrometry. METex14del mutations resulting in MET exon 14 skipping will be determined by DNA sequencing and confirmed with RNA sequencing. Subjects will be enrolled as follows:\n\nCohort 1: Subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that overexpress MET\nCohort 2: Subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors that harbor METex14del mutations Simon's two-stage optimal design will be utilized separately for each cohort to assess the primary efficacy endpoint ORR. The null hypothesis of Simon's two-stage design states that the ORR will be ≤ 10% (poor response) and will be tested against a one-sided alternative."
