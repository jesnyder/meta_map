      "BriefSummary": "Subjects entering the study will have undergone cardiac surgery. Those who experience kidney injury within 48 hours of their surgery will be enrolled into the study. Once enrolled, subjects will receive a single administration of AC607 or placebo. Kidney recovery will be evaluated over the subsequent 30 days and death or the need for dialysis will be evaluated within 90 days of dosing. After 90 days (evaluation period), subjects will enter a 3-year extension phase of the study to monitor safety and long-term outcomes (follow-up period).",
      "DetailedDescription": "The study will enroll post-cardiac surgery subjects (CABG and/or valve) with laboratory evidence of AKI within 48 hrs of removal from cardiopulmonary bypass. Subjects will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to treatment with a single administration of AC607 or placebo (approximately 100 subjects per group).\n\nSafety and efficacy assessments will be performed daily during the post-operative hospital stay from the day randomized into the study until discharge, at 30 days, and at 90 days after study drug administration (evaluation phase). Safety and long-term clinical outcomes will be assessed at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months (long-term follow-up phase)."
