      "BriefSummary": "This is a study to assess safety and preliminary clinical activity of treatments of liver cirrhosis in patients with caused by Hepatitis C and Hepatitis B or Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis of Mesenchymal stem cell.\n\nPatients who will be enrolled in the study will be under supervision and monitoring to ensure clinical significance",
      "DetailedDescription": "Liver cirrhosis refers to extreme scarring of the liver, resulting in suboptimal function of the liver. It can result from a variety of causes, ranging from hepatitis B and C infection, excessive alcohol consumption, autoimmune causes, fatty liver and others. Irrespective of the cause, once the liver becomes cirrhotic, it is a downhill course.\n\nLiver cirrhosis is irreversible and most patients will progressively worsen over time. Once liver cirrhosis has reached the stage of decompensation, that is, development of jaundice, ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy the two-year survival drops to about 50%.\n\nThe definitive treatment of decompensated cirrhosis is liver transplantation. While a liver transplantation is potentially curative, the high costs, lack of a donor, treatment-related mortality and the immunosuppression complications make this option possible only for a limited number of patients. The vast majority do not have an effective option at all, thus the need to develop alternative therapies. Various types of Stem Cells had been investigated as a regenerative therapy for liver cirrhosis. These stem cells include bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Some early studies have shown encouraging results in patients who had autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation. There was improved liver function in these patients with cirrhotic livers.\n\nThe sponsor is proposing a study to look into the role of MSC therapy for patients with liver cirrhosis in Ukraine. This will be a Phase I study with the main emphasis on the safety and efficiency profile first. The trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP and local regulatory requirement(s)."
