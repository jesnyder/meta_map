Efficiency will be assessed using measures of the time taken to meet specific milestones within the study\nTo assess the ability of the network to collect high quality biospecimens adhering to agreed-upon protocols.\nTo gauge the willingness of participants to participate in subsequent Fox BioNet studies"
