Only patients whose values are in the normal range as determined by the laboratory norms based on age and sex will be allowed to participate.\nUse of systemic chemotherapeutic or anti-mitotic medications within three months of study start date due to the possibility of interference with bone marrow procedure\nAny patients with a history of or with active malignancy\nUse of steroids within three months of the study start date, as this would suggest a highly active disease state\nHistory of cirrhosis due to increased risk of central nervous system (CNS) infection\nPoorly controlled hypertension because of increased risk for stroke or CNS hemorrhage. Specifically, any patient with a systolic blood pressure value of ≥ 145 mm/Hg or a diastolic blood pressure value of ≥ 95 mm/Hg will be excluded from study participation.\nHistory of thyroid disorders or other endocrine disorders because of hormone influence on cell growth\nHistory of central nervous system infection or immunodeficiency syndromes due to increased risk of CNS infection\nPreexisting blood disease (such as bone marrow hypoplasia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or significant anemia) due to invasive nature of bone-marrow aspiration\nPrevious or current history of a coagulation disorder\nAny metal in the body, which is contraindicated for MRI studies\nAllergy to any of the antibiotics used in this study, e.g. tobramycin, vancomycin, or gentamicin\nPatients with alcohol or other substance abuse problems\nOther major disease that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, would preclude participation in the study\nPatients with HBV, HCV, syphilis, HIV-1, or HIV-2.\nAny evidence of significant cognitive dysfunction based on a screening history and physical examination because it would preclude giving a truly informed consent\nPatients who are enrolled in another clinical trial for MS treatment or who have received any study drug/biologics within the last 6 months",
