      "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of the investigational product, SBI-101, in subjects with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) who require continuous renal replacement therapy. SBI-101 is a biologic/device combination product designed to regulate inflammation and promote repair of injured tissue using allogeneic human mesenchymal stromal cells.\n\nThe study will be conducted in two cohorts, with an interim analysis performed in between the cohorts. In the first cohort, subjects will be randomized to receive one of two treatments - low dose SBI-101 or sham control. In the second cohort, subjects will be randomized to receive one of two treatments - high dose SBI-101 or sham control. SBI-101 or sham control will be integrated into the renal replacement circuit and subjects in both cohorts will be treated for up to 24 hours."
