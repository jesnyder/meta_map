      "BriefSummary": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common and chronic lung disease that occurs in preterm infants following ventilator and oxygen therapy and is associated with long-term health consequences. Preclinical research shows that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can modify a number of pathophysiological processes that are central to the progression of BPD and thus present as a promising new treatment option. The main purpose of this Phase I study is to evaluate the safety of human umbilical cord tissue-derived MSCs in extremely preterm infants at risk of developing BPD.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Complications of extreme preterm birth are the primary cause of mortality in children under the age of five. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease that follows ventilator and oxygen therapy for acute respiratory failure, is the most common complication of extreme prematurity and contributes to life-long respiratory and neurological impairment. Currently, there is no effective treatment for BPD. The multi-factorial nature of BPD makes it challenging for traditional pharmacological therapies targeting a single pathway to have a major impact on outcome. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may provide a promising new treatment avenue due to their pleiotropic effects that may prevent neonatal lung injury while promoting lung (and other organ) growth. A systematic review and meta-analysis of all preclinical studies testing MSCs in neonatal lung injury models provides strong evidence for the lung protective effect of MSCs. Additionally, studies in a large preclinical model of extreme prematurity and chronic lung injury suggest feasibility, safety and short-term hemodynamic benefit of intravenously delivered human umbilical cord tissue-derived MSCs (uc-MSC).\n\nThe aim of this study is to establish the safety, maximum feasible dose and feasibility of intravenously delivered allogeneic uc-MSCs in preterm infants at risk of developing BPD. This will be a Phase 1, open-label, single center, dose-escalating trial using a 3+3+3 design."
