      "DetailedDescription": "This is a clinical trial phase II, single-center, non-randomized, uncontrolled, open prospective follow-up of a cohort of patients with chronic spinal cord injury.\n\nPatients are treated with repeated administrations of in vitro expanded autologous adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.\n\nThe expanded cells are administered in the subarachnoid space by lumbar puncture. The minimum duration of the follow-up period for each patient is 10 months after the first administration.\n\nThe study duration is 24 months, that include recruiting, treatment and follow period for all patients. For each patient at the first day will be administered the first cellular doses, then 3 doses will be administrated every 3 months. At the end of the clinical trial, a completed check of all obtained parameters will be performed.\n\nIt is considered Day 1 for each patient the first day of the first cell administration. The remaining 2 doses will be administered at intervals of 3 months from the first administration (of the treatment period after, months 4 and 7). At the end of the study will be performed a full assessment of the variables collected along the study trial."
