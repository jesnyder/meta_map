A total of 18 SSc patients will be enrolled in 3 successive blocks of 6 patients each. After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written informed consent will be randomized to one of two treatment arms or a placebo arm (total of 6 patients per arm). Within each block, the 6 patients will be randomized in a 2:2:2 ratio in one of the following arms: placebo, 1 infusion of UCMSC (M0), or 2 infusions of UCMSC (M0, M3). Second infusions of UCMSC will be performed only in the absence of Severe Adverse Events (SAE). Randomization into blocks 2 and 3 will be staggered, to allow the detection of SAE prior to inclusion of patients in a subsequent block, i.e. the second block will be randomized only in the absence of SAE one month after the first infusion of all 6 patients in block one, and similarly for the third block."
