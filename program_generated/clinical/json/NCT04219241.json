      "DetailedDescription": "This extension study will include the subjects who participated the study phase II for dose-response evaluation of Cellavita-HD intravenous administration in Huntington's disease patients (maximum 35 subjects). Because it is a extension study, with an open scenario, the subjects will receive the maximum dose tested in the last clinical trial (ADORE-DH), corresponding to 6 x 10^6 cells/weight range for each treatment cycle planned. Throughout of 24 months, the subjects will receive total dose planned divided into three administrations per cycle (2 x 10^6 cells/weight range), that each will occur every 30 days. The maintaining the effectiveness of intravenous administration of Cellavita-HD product over time on clinical progression Huntington's disease will be verified by comparing the UHDRS total score at the end of the 24th study month against baseline score. Secondary evidences of efficacy will be evaluated by through the data of functional state, total functional capacity, functional independence, psychiatric symptoms and cognition from UHDRS scale. Additionally, related data to clinical worsening, change of Body Mass Index (BMI), risk of suicide attempt and neurological image improvement will be evaluated. Safety evaluation will included the incidence and classification of the adverse events experienced by the subjects during the study."

Cognitive operations are assessed by aplication of three tests: verbal fluency test, Symbol Digit modalities test and the Stroop Color Word test. For all cognitive tests, highest scores translate to better cognitive ability. Behavior assessment score is obtained by summing different items related to the severity of psychiatric symptoms. Highest scores indicate greater behavioral impairment. Functional assessment includes three scales: a functional checklist, an independence scale, and a total functional capacity assessment. The maximum score of 25 points represents greater functional capacity.",
