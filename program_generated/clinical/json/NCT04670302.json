      "BriefSummary": "This is a non-randomized clinical trial conducted in a single tertiary hospital which investigates the efficacy of allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells and human amniotic membrane (AAdMSC-HAM) composite for supraspinatus tendon repair augmentation",
      "DetailedDescription": "Supraspinatus tendon tear is the most common factor causing shoulder pain, mainly resulting in discomfort and functional deficit in individuals over the age of 35. Supraspinatus tendon repair surgery represents one of the most widely performed types of orthopedic operation. Nevertheless, concerns persist regarding tendon-to-bone healing during the postoperative period. Despite advancements in surgical technique, re-tear of a previously repaired supraspinatus tendon is a fairly common complication, especially in a larger size tear. Such repair technique employing suture anchor devices alone has not yet produced functional results demonstrating both anatomical and biomechanical properties. Therefore, tendon tissue engineering using a combination of scaffolds, cells, and growth factors stimulation offers a potential solution as a biological augmentation in tendon repair.\n\nHuman amniotic membrane (HAM) has been widely used as a natural scaffold in tissue engineering due to many of its unique properties such as providing growth factors, cytokines and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, adequate mechanical strength, and biocompatibility. Whereas, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) constitute one of the adult stem cells that promote replacement and repair of damaged tissue along with normal tissue turnover. These MSCs are seeded to the HAM scaffolds to biologically augment tendon repair, with MSCs acting as cytokines/growth factors to stimulate tissue repair. This approach serves as the foundation to conduct the present study. The investigators aim to investigate the efficacy of using allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs and human amniotic membrane (AAdMSC-HAM) composite for supraspinatus tendon repair augmentation."

We hypothesize that the augmentation using HAM (as scaffold) seeded with AAdMSC would further lower the re-tear rates. We plan to record the recurrence of supraspinatus tendon tear (if any) based on radiographic evaluation with ultrasonography, which will then be confirmed with MRI. Ultrasonography provides an excellent anatomical evaluation of soft tissue which is able to assess any alterations during active locomotion. However, due to its user-dependent nature, we will also confirm the findings with MRI examination. Any grade of re-tear (grade I-III as evaluated by ultrasonography and confirmed with MRI) will be counted in and classified as \"re-tear\". When the patients do not complain about any symptoms of re-tear, we will record them as \"no re-tear\".",
