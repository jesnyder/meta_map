      "BriefSummary": "The primary objective of this study is to to verify the feasibility of obtaining and comparing two epithelia in two populations based on the following experiments:\n\nDifferentiation of an Induced Pluripotent Stem cell (iPS) clone derived from cutaneous biopsy in a population of heavy smokers (plus patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) in order to obtain differentiated bronchial epithelia in vitro.\nFor each of these same patients, generation of bronchial epithelium in vitro from bronchial biopsy using human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Secondary objectives:\n\nConfrontation of the two models of in vitro generation of bronchial epithelium by iPS and ALI in order to validate our model of study of the human bronchial epithelium COPD generated by the iPS.\nInducing a \"COPD-like\" epithelial phenotype by exposing the bronchial epithelia generated from the iPS to a source of in vitro toxin (tobacco) and studying its effects by transcriptomic analysis via high-throughput sequencing (NGS) at key steps during the model.\nDemonstrate the feasibility of obtaining iPS from peripheral blood sampling."
