      "BriefSummary": "Xerostomia, or dry mouth, is a common side effect of head neck radiation. Current treatment options for radiation-induced xerostomia are generally supportive in nature. Most of these supportive interventions do not reverse xerostomia and are palliative in intent.\n\nThe investigators propose that autotransplantation of marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in salivary glands post-RT or post-chemoradiation therapy (CRT) may provide an innovative remedy to treat xerostomia and restore quality of life.\n\nParticipants can expect to be on study for up to 6 months.",
      "DetailedDescription": "This feasibility study will analyze the salivary composition, salivary viscoelasticity, salivary gland US, and QoL surveys of participants without head and neck cancer (HNC) to determine standard values. The investigators will then compare this to the salivary composition and viscoelasticity of participants with treated HNC.\n\nAdditionally, the investigators will examine the paracrine factors of marrow MSCs in order to prove a hypothesis that paracine factors constitutively expressed by marrow MSCs [Wnts, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), GDNF and others] will directly influence the biology of dormant salivary gland stem cells following intraglandular transplantation and allow for functional recovery following RT.\n\nPrimary Objective\n\nTo determine the feasibility of in vitro expansion of marrow-derived MSCs from HNC patients to >50 million cells.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\nTo assess the stability of salivary function in HNC patients using quality-of-life (QoL) questionnaires and salivary composition analysis.\nTo assess the stability of salivary gland size as measured by ultrasound.\n\nCorrelative Objectives\n\nTo compare assess the secretome profile of MSCs from HNC patients treated with radiation or, chemoradiation, or previously untreated.\nTo compare the salivary composition, viscoelasticity, salivary gland ultrasound, and QoL of HNC patients to non-HNC patients"
