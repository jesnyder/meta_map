      "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Expanded Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells on patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. Any adverse events related to UCMSCs infusion will be monitored.The primary outcome is the improvement rate of PASI(Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) and treatment response will be computed from PASI before and after UCMSCs infusion.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Psoriasis is an immune-mediated, genetic disease manifesting in the skin or joints or both. Numerous topical and systemic therapies are available for the treatment of psoriasis. Treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease severity, relevant comorbidities, patient preference. For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy, systemic therapy and biologic immune modifying agents are recommended, but all of them have some drawbacks or limitations. Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to find new treatment for psoriasis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a kind of adult stem cells that can differentiate into bone, cartilage and adipose cells. Umbilical cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells were isolated from umbilical cord matrix and were reported to treat moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris and psoriasis arthritis successfully by case reports. For the mechanism of the disease, involvement of the immune system in psoriasis is now widely accepted. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are found to have the function of immunomodulation, migration to skin lesions, limitation of autoimmunity. Therefore, investigators supposed that the injection of UCMSCs could be beneficial for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis."
