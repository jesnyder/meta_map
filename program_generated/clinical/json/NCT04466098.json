      "BriefSummary": "This is a multi-center, randomized, placebo controlled, interventional phase 2A trial to evaluate the safety profile and potential efficacy of multi-dosing of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) for patients with SARS-CoV-2 associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). After informed consent, treatment assignment will be made by computer-generated randomization to administer either MSC or vehicle placebo control with a 2:1 allocation to the MSC: placebo arm.",
      "DetailedDescription": "MSCs are adult, non-hematopoietic precursor cells derived from a variety of tissues (e.g., bone marrow, adipose tissue, and placenta) and have been used as therapy in multiple conditions, especially in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as graft versus-host disease (GVHD) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with evidence of benefit.\n\nIn preclinical models, MSC are effective in ameliorating acute lung injury due to their ability to secrete paracrine factors that regulate lung endothelial and epithelial permeability, including growth factors, anti-inflammatory cytokines, and antimicrobial peptides. Based on the promising pre-clinical preliminary data and intriguing results in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia and ARDS as well as an established safety profile of MSC generally and in ARDS in particular, the researchers propose multiple dosing of MSCs as a study treatment to ameliorate the severity and duration of SARS-CoV-2 associated pneumonia and ARDS potentially improve survival.\n\nPatients will receive study agent (MSC or placebo) within 48 hours of enrollment. Three doses will be administered unless a severe infusion adverse event occurs that is related to the MSC infusion. Doses will be repeated approximately every 48-72 hours with the aim of completing 3 doses within 7 days of the first dose. All patients will receive standard of care treatments for ARDS."
