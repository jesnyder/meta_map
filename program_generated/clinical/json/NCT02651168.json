      "BriefSummary": "Diabetic macular edema refers to swelling (fluid accumulation) in the center of the retina. The retina is like the film of a camera and is located in the back of the eye. This condition can develop in diabetics where swelling results from leaking of fluid from the blood vessels of the eye, into the center of the retina, the macula. If left untreated, this can affect central.\n\nThe current standard treatment for diabetic macular edema includes medications injected directly into the eye (intravitreal injections) and laser eye treatment. The drugs that are injected directly into the eye are known as anti-VEGF agents which help to reduce the leaking. This includes bevacizumab (Avastin®) and ranibizumab (Lucentis®).\n\nHowever, some patients do not respond well to these anti-VEGF treatments and will be given the option of switching to an another newer anti-VEGF medication, called aflibercept (Eylea®) that is approved to treat DME. A recent large study has demonstrated that aflibercept was as efficacious as other anti-VEGF therapies listed above and was even superior in patients with worse vision (Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network, Wells JA, Glassman AR, et al. Aflibercept, Bevacizumab, or Ranibizumab for Diabetic Macular Edema. N Engl J Med. 2015:150218140025008-150218140025008).\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine what factors affect the treatment response to aflibercept (amount of swelling reduction) for patients with diabetic macular edema, who were previously unresponsive to ranibizumab injections."
