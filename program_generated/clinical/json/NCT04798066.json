The investigational product will be an add-on treatment to the standard of care.\n\nIND 027966 - HBPD05\n\nThis is an Intermediate Size Patient Population Expanded Access IND to Evaluate the Safety of autologous HB-adMSCs for the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease.",
      "DetailedDescription": "IND 019680 - HBPCOVID01\n\nThe dose to use for this Intermediate- Size Patient Population Expanded Access Protocol is 200 million HB-adMSCs, administered through intravenous infusion only, with a treatment duration of 14 weeks, infusion rate 4-5ml/min and total volume of 250 ml Sodium chloride 0.9%. A total of 5 administrations and a dosing interval of two weeks for the first two HB-adMSCs administrations and one month after that.\n\nIND 027966 - HBPD05\n\nThis expanded access program was developed to include ten patients between 76 and 95 y/o diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. The expanded access program will last for 26 weeks, during which time the eligible patients will receive six intravenous infusions of autologous Hope Biosciences adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Each investigational product administration will be monitored for 2 hours at the following intervals: 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. During the infusion and the follow-up visit, volunteers will be evaluated for the incidence of any serious or non-serious adverse event occurrences."
