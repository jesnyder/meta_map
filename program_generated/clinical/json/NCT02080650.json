The primary objective of this pilot study will be to describe the numbers of c-MET expressing cells that can be detected by the c-MET CTC capture technique. These data will be separated by disease site. The investigator will also describe the detection rates of both the c-MET CTC capture and the EpCAM CTC capture techniques in each patient, also separated by disease site."
