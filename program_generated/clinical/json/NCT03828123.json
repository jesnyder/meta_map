      "BriefSummary": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that targets motor neurons. Prognosis is invariably fatal within 3-5 years since manifestation of the disease. Despite improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying ALS, the treatment remains essentially only supportive and focused on symptoms relief. Over the past few years, stem cell research has expanded greatly as a tool for developing new therapies to treat incurable diseases. Stem cell therapy has been shown as promising in several animal ALS models and human clinical trials.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Subjects will be assigned to autologous mesenchymal stromal cell (AMSC) treatment according to inclusion and exclusion criteria (see below) screened four times prior to administration. Then the subjects will be observed for three consecutive yearsAfter a half year of screening period, the autologous multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells from bone marrow will be isolated. The cells will be cultivated for 3 passages (3 - 4 weeks) in order to get sufficient amount for therapy, cell suspension for intrathecal application will be prepared and introduced intrathecally through lumbar puncture. Subsequently, all the subjects will be observed at the range of standard medical care used at these types of interventions."
