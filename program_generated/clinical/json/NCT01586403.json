      "DetailedDescription": "The goal of this study is to establish the recommended phase two dose of autologous T cell receptor transduced T cells when administered with low dose IL-2 to stage IV melanoma patients following a non-myeloablative and lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen. A secondary objective is to evaluate biologic and immunologic parameters associated with the adoptively transferred T cell receptor transduced T cells, including auditory and visual changes. The investigators believe the infusion of T cell receptor gene modified autologous T cells can mediate objective clinical responses in stage IV melanoma patients."
