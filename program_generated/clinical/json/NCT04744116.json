      "BriefSummary": "This early phase I trial is to find out the effect of adding cord blood tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (cb-MSCs) to ruxolitinib in treating patients with acute graft versus host disease that does not respond to steroid therapy (steroid-refractory). Ruxolitinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. cb-MSCs are a type of tissue helper cell that can be removed from donated umbilical cord blood tissue and grown into many different cell types that can be used to treat cancer and other disease, such as graft versus host disease. This trial aims to learn if adding cb-MSCs to ruxolitinib may help control steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease.",
      "DetailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To estimate between-arm differences (Arm 3 versus [vs] Arm 1, and Arm 2 vs Arm 1) for each of the 28-day co-primary outcome probabilities.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.\n\nARM 1: Patients receive ruxolitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for at least 3 days and may consider tapering after 6 months of therapy if response occurs and therapeutic corticosteroid doses have been discontinued.\n\nARM 2: Patients receive ruxolitinib PO BID as in Arm 1. Patients also receive lower dose of cb-MSCs intravenously (IV) for up to 60 minutes twice weekly (at least 3 days apart) over 4 consecutive weeks for 8 total doses.\n\nARM 3: Patients receive ruxolitinib PO BID as in Arm 1. Patients also receive higher dose of cb-MSCs IV for up to 60 minutes twice weekly (at least 3 days apart) over 4 consecutive weeks for 8 total doses.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on day 28 and then for up to 6 months."
