Assay performance will be assessed and those demonstrating high sensitivity and consistency will be considered for further development.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nTo assess the ability of the assay or a combination of assays to differentiate pathogenic LRRK2 variant manifesting and non-manifesting carriers, idiopathic PD and healthy non-carriers."
