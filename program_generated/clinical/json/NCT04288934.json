      "BriefSummary": "This study aims to assess and compare the safety and effectiveness of Autologous Bone Marrow-Derived MSCs (AutoBM-MSCs) in one group(group A) of SCI who are unlikely to be able to walk independently without treatment after 1 year of SCI, in the other group (group B) to assess the second group of Wharton Jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells ( WJ-MSCs) in the treatment of acute and subacute spinal cord injury (SCI) patients.",
      "DetailedDescription": "The study will be directed by the Cell Therapy Center (CTC) in Jordan, where 20 SCI patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be recruited and divided according to the type of injury into two groups; Group A for patients with complete transection of the spinal cord, and Group B for SCI without a total transaction,10 patients will receive (AutoBM-MSCs)and the other 10 patients with acute and subacute spinal cord injury will receive(WJ-MSCs) by a specialized spine surgeon into the spinal medulla. The outcomes and improvements will be assessed using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) and the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) version III, in addition to blood tests, MRI, and somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP)."
