      "BriefSummary": "Management of chronic low back pain (LBP) has contributed to its high socioeconomic burden. The intervertebral disc accounts for 40% or more cases of chronic LBP. Available treatment options do not improve the underlying degenerative condition, although they do resolve its symptoms. This indicates the need for new therapies and/or interventions that actually treat the underlying causes of discogenic pain. Biological therapies by direct injection of PRP into the annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus seems an effective and feasible option.\n\nExosomes derived from blood may potentially transmit some of the unique stem cell properties to other stem cells, facilitating stemness maintenance, differentiation, self-renewal, and repair. We propose to have a controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial to compare the safety and efficacy of exosomes in LBP. Informed consent will be obtained from all subjects prior to study participation. Patients will be randomized into 2 arms with either to receive PRP with exosomes at the centre of the nucleus pulposus or equal amount of placebo and will be evaluated by 2 interventional spine and medicine physicians.\n\nOutcome measures Primary Visual analog scale (VAS), Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ), SF 36 health questionnaire, Functional rating index Secondary: MRI - disc degeneration grading, T2 quantification, Adverse events any evidence of discitis or discontinuation , worsening of pain will be deeply analyzed.\n\nMonitoring visits will be conducted according to standard monitoring procedures. Differences in paired samples will be compared using the two-tailed Student's t-test. All routine monitoring functions will be performed prior to the study termination visit.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Eligibility and patient selection: This active control, randomized, double-blind trial will be conducted as per guidelines of Helsinki declaration on ethical conduct of human studies. Participants with a history of chronic LBP who met inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited. Participants will be evaluated by 2 interventional spine and medicine physicians. Eligible patients will be provided with the IRB-approved protocol and informed consent will be taken prior to study.\n\nPRP Preparation:\n\nBlood sample (60 ml) will be centrifuged at 600×g for 10 min to collect plasma fraction. And centrifuged at 4000×g for 15 min. Supernatant platelet poor plasma (PPP) will be then removed, leaving 1 ml PRP. PPP will be passed through one-micron special indigenous designed flush back filter (Alpha Corpuscle, Delhi, India) so that all the platelets present in PPP fraction will get trapped in the filter. These trapped platelets will be flushed back with 1 ml of PPP to retrieve most of the platelets. This will be mixed together and then passed through a WBC filter (Terumo Imuguard, USA) to filter off the leukocytes. The final PRP concentrate (0.1 ml) will be analysed for total leukocyte & platelet counts. Five samples will be selected randomly treated with bovine thrombin reconstituted in 10% calcium chloride will be assessed for growth factors [platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF)] by ELISA.\n\nOn an average our PRP sample will have 100 billion platelets and 30x concentrate of blood platelet in 2ml of final PRP.\n\nExosomes preparation:\n\nSixty ml of blood in EDTA-coated tubes will be spin at 1,200 g for 10 minutes at 4°C to separate plasma. Plasma will be filtered with (0.22 μm) filter. Avoid any pelleted material while transferring the plasma. Discard the pelleted material. This tube has special filter to concentrate exosomes and other growth promoting proteins. Tube will be centrifuged at 3000 g, RT, 30 min and exosomes will be collected and then will be concentrated (0.5 ml to 3ml). To recover exosomes clogged in wall of filter -add 20 ml NS (preferably PBS) into micro centrifuge tube and rinsed it by centrifugation at 3,500 g. Collect the concentrated soup of exosomes again which were clogged in filter wall.\n\nQuantification of protein content will be done by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay.\n\nNanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) Vesicle suspensions with concentrations between 1×107/ml and 1×109/ml will be examined using a Nanosight NS300 (NanoSight Ltd., UK) equipped with a 405 nm laser to determine the size and quantity of particles isolated. A video of 60-sec duration will be taken with a frame rate of 30 frames/sec, and particle movement will be analyzed using NTA software (version 2.3; NanoSight Ltd.).\n\nWestern blot analysis The exosome supernatant will be denatured in sample buffer and will be subjected to western blot analysis. Purified exosomes will be analysed for protein expression HSP70, flottilin, CD63, TSG101 and calnexin. The proteins were visualized on the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS Imager system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Berkeley, CA, USA).\n\nStudy Design\n\nRandomisation and Arms of the study:\n\nApproximately Three hundred patients will be screened to randomly allocate to treatment or control groups at a 1:1 ratio, to assign 30 patients into each 4 arm:\n\nArm I will be assigned to receive placebo (trigger point injection under C arm)\n\nArm II: to receive PRP with exosomes at the center of the nucleus pulposus (2ml) Test product(s), dose and mode of administration duration of treatment Patients will be randomly selected based on computer generated number to receive one undistinguishable injection of PRP ex or placebo. Following skin disinfection of the back 2 ml from the total PRPex procured was injected as soon as possible by an fluoroscopy guided lateral approach. Patients received the placebo in a similar manner but not to disc .it will be in muscles zone around trigger point .Physician who evaluated the study and patient were unknown of treatment. Patients were advised to continue with usual exercises, routine precautions, physiotherapy and back care.\n\nParacetamol (to a maximum of up to one gram) three times a day, will be allowed to be used as a rescue drug. No systemic corticosteroid, potential symptom-modifying drug /procedure will be allowed during the study.\n\nStudy assessments / Outcome measures\n\nVisual analog scale (VAS)\nRoland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ)\nSF 36 health questionnaire\nFunctional rating index\n\nMRI - disc degeneration grading, T2 quantification any evidence of discitis Patients will be assessed by visual analog scale (VAS), SF 36 health questionnaire, Functional rating index at baseline and followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The structural efficacy will evaluated by MRI t2 quantification and grading as described earlier in literature at baseline and at 6 months by two experienced radiologists. Assessors will be blinded.\n\nThe patients will be evaluated for any adverse effects and vital signs once a week for the first month and then once a month up to 6 months. Blood samples were collected at the time of entry into the study, at six months, and on a final visit to examine biological variables as well as liver and kidney functions. Tolerability was assessed and laboratory-based haematological and biochemical assays were performed. A possible causal relationship with the treatment arm will also be assessed.\n\nDiscontinuation from treatment with a specific reason will be ascertained. Any evidence of infection/discitis will be delicately observed. Worsening of pain will be deeply analyzed.\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS:\n\nAnalysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to investigate the differences between groups. Differences in paired samples will be compared using the two-tailed Student's t-test. Correlations between variables will be assessed by Pearson's correlation. SPSS 20.0 will be used for statistical analyses (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). P<0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant.\n\nIdentification of the relationship between safety issues/side effects and arousal level using measurement by rating scales. To test whether the relationship between safety issues/side effects and arousal level differs between IBRF ACP/MCP vs. Standard of Care groups, using measurement by rating scales, two analyses will be conducted. Canonical correlation will be used to determine which side effect (or combination of side effects) explains variance in the rating scale measurements. Additionally, cluster analysis will be employed to determine whether side effects are similarly related to arousal levels and outcomes for patients in the three treatment groups.\n\nMONITORING PROCEDURES/ADVERSE EVENTS / SAFETY ENDPOINTS Monitoring The monitors will visit the center during the study in addition to maintaining frequent telephone and written communication.\n\nThe following guidelines meet the requirements specified in 21 CFR §812.46 and are provided to describe the procedures for monitoring the clinical studies. If the investigator is not complying with the signed Investigator Agreement, the protocol, or any condition of the study (e.g., incomplete data forms), the monitor has the right to terminate the investigator's participation in the study.\n\nPre-Study Monitoring Procedures\n\nThe designate (i.e. monitor) will be responsible for determining and documenting that each investigator clearly understands and accepts the responsibilities and obligations incurred in conducting a clinical study.
