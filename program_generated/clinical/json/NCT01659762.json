      "BriefSummary": "In this Phase I trial the investigators intend to show safety and tolerability of autologous MSC, expanded using a non-xenogeneic, human component platelet lysate expansion media. Fresh, non cryopreserved, autologous MSCs will delivered intravenously as a single bolus dose in a dose escalation phase I study. The investigators intend to test whether the product is clinically safe in adults (18-65 years old) with CD and to determine maximal deliverable dose. Secondary endpoint will monitor effectiveness using CDAI as an endpoint.",
      "DetailedDescription": "EPIC MSC/IBD is made up of autologous marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells ex vivo expanded numerically for approximately 14 days using pooled human Platelet Lysate (phPL), harvested on the day of infusion, washed and suspended at a concentration of 4 million cells/ml in Plasmalyte A with 0.5% human serum albumin. This is a phase I dose-escalation, open label, non-randomized, non-placebo controlled, single group assignment study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous infusion of EPIC MSC2011-001. EPIC EPIC MSC/IBD will be infused intravenously and will be administered at one of three dose levels: (Tier 1) 2 million cells/kg patient body weight; (Tier 2) 5 million cells/kg, and (Tier 3) 10 million cells/kg. This Phase I clinical trial will enroll 16-20 subjects with moderate to severe Crohn's. The duration of this study for each patient is 12 weeks. The investigators anticipate that this study will be completed within 2 years of commencement.\n\nPrimary objective: To describe and compare the safety and tolerability of a single infusion of fresh autologous bone marrow derived Mesenchymal stromal cells infused to patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease.\n\nSecondary objective: Efficacy of autologous bone marrow derived Mesenchymal stromal cells infusion to patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease as assessed through disease activity index, and quality of life index.\n\nSafety variables:Adverse events (AEs),Laboratory parameters (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis), Vital signs."
