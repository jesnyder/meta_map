      "BriefSummary": "Cirrhosis of the liver is a common clinical chronic progressive liver disease, which is a diffuse liver lesion caused by one or more causes over a long period of time or repeatedly. Nodules, abnormal spherical areas of cells, form as dying liver cells are replaced by regenerating cells. This regeneration of cells causes the liver to become hard. The potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed. In particular, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has been applicated in the clinic for treat several human diseases such as liver injury and liver fibrosis displayed good tolerance and efficiency. Besides, regulatory T cells(Tregs) had been proved as an immune regualtory T cell subsets, which could reduce immune cell activation and reduce liver injury severity. The purpose of this study is to learn whether and how MSCs and Tregs can improve the disease conditions in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Cirrhosis of the liver is a common clinical chronic progressive liver disease, which is a diffuse liver lesion caused by one or more causes over a long period of time or repeatedly. Nodules, abnormal spherical areas of cells, form as dying liver cells are replaced by regenerating cells. This regeneration of cells causes the liver to become hard. Decompensated liver cirrhosis is mainly manifested by liver function damage and portal hypertension, with multiple system involvement. Complications such as upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatic encephalopathy, secondary infection, hypersplenism, ascites, and carcinogenesis often occur in the late stage. The potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed.
