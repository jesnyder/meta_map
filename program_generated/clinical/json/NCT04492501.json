      "BriefSummary": "Beyond supportive care, there are currently no proven treatment options for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and related pneumonia, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Investigators have seen recently from experience in Western countries with best health care systems that pandemics cannot be managed in hospitals. Investigators have seen ICUs crowded to capacity, healthcare workers being exposed and going to quarantine or dying after exposure to large doses of viral inoculums. Investigators recommend that institutions should register for Clinical trials and consider emergency use of TPE. In Pandemics, time is of essence to avoid mortality by intervening early with available evidence, preferably as part of clinical trial.Since the outbreak of corona virus disease (COVID-19), main treatment modalities have been antivirals, interferons, glucocorticoids, anti-coagulants and supportive treatment in addition to traditional Chinese medicine. There are also clinical trials exploring hydroxyquinoline / chloroquine sulphate, azithromycin, immunoglobulins, Vitamin-C, washed microbiota, nebulized interferon, teicoplanin as well as Mesenchymal stem cells. However, most of these trials were small and remain in the experimental phase with currently no effective / speciﬁc antiviral with robust scientific evidence as regards the mortality reduction in COVID-19.In an attempt to treat COVID-19, investigator will use different investigational treatment either alone or in combination to see mortality and morbidity benefit on the basis of limitted evidence available so far. These investigational modalities include Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), Convalescent Plasma (CP), Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in addition to standard supportive treatment.",
