      "BriefSummary": "This is a Phase I study to evaluate the safety profile of a type of immune therapy called HER2 CAR T cells (short for HER2 chimeric antigen receptor T cells). In addition to looking for side effects, we will study how well this treatment works against a brain tumor called ependymoma that has come back after treatment (recurrent) or has not responded well to treatment (progressive) in children. The HER2 CAR T cells used in this trial are made from the patient's own blood. A new gene, called the HER2 CAR, will be inserted into patient's T cells to allow them recognize a protein on the tumor called HER2. These HER2-specific CAR T cells may be able to target and kill ependymoma tumors that express HER2. This research is also studying how doable it is to provide this type of CAR T cell treatment to children being treated at different hospitals.",
      "DetailedDescription": "PBTC-059 is a multicenter, Phase I and Surgical study of the treatment HER2-specific CAR T cells for patients with refractory or recurrent ependymoma.\n\nPhase I\n\nThe primary objectives of the Phase I study are to determine the safety of intravenous injection of HER2-specific CAR T cells after lymphodepleting chemotherapy, and to evaluate the multicenter feasibility of administering up to three infusions of HER2-CAR T cells after lymphodepletion.\n\nPatients will receive one infusion of HER2psecific CAR T cells after lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Following recovery from their first treatment (no earlier than 8 weeks and no later than 12 weeks), patients will resume treatment with HER2-specific CAR T cells for up to 2 infusions after lymphodepleting chemotherapy if they meet laboratory parameters.\n\nThe length of time on study for patients enrolled on the Phase I study is anticipated to be 9 months on treatment. Patients will then be followed for 15 years after treatment.\n\nSurgical Study\n\nThe objective of the Surgical study is to evaluate the post-treatment tumor tissue for presence of HER2-specific CAR T cells administered intravenously in children undergoing surgical resection. The surgical study will be initiated following completion of the safety evaluation period of 6 patients treated in the Phase I study.\n\nOnce the surgical study is open for enrollment, all patients who have clinical indication for surgery, except those needing urgent surgery, will be eligible for enrollment to the surgical study. Patients will receive one infusion of HER2-specific CAR T cells after lymphodepleting chemotherapy 4-6 weeks before surgical resection of their tumor, at which time samples will be taken for analysis. Following recovery from surgery (no earlier than 8 weeks and no later than 15 weeks), patients will resume treatment with HER2-specific CAR T cells for up to 2 infusions if they meet laboratory parameters.\n\nThe first patient in the surgical study will complete a 6-week safety evaluation period prior to enrollment of the subsequent patient. The length of time on study for patients enrolled on the Surgical study is anticipated to be 10 months on treatment. Patients will then be followed for 15 years after treatment.\n\nDosing\n\nAll patients on Phase I and Surgical study will receive HER2 CAR T cells at a patient-specific dose level 1 (8x10^7 CAR-positive T cells/m^2) for infusion. The cell dose will be based on the patient weight and height obtained by the treating institution at the time of procurement. For patients whose BMI is greater than 95th percentile for given age and sex, the Body surface area (BSA) will be calculated using the ideal body weight.\n\nIn the event that dose level 1 is found to have excessive toxicity, three additional doses of CAR T cells at dose level -1 (5x10^7 CAR-positive T cells/m^2) will be made to be used in the event that dose de-escalation occurs before a patient is enrolled for treatment."

A baseline detailed neurological exam should clearly document the neurological status of the patient at the time of enrollment for treatment on the study.\n\nPatients with seizure disorders may be enrolled if seizures are well controlled.\n\nPerformance Status\n\nKarnofsky Performance Scale (KPS for > 16 years of age) or Lansky Performance Score (LPS for ≤ 16 years of age) (Appendix C) assessed within one week of enrollment must be ≥ 60%. Patients who are unable to walk because of neurologic deficits, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the performance score.\n\nOrgan Function\n\nPatients must have adequate organ and bone marrow function as defined in Section 3.2.1.4.\n\nPregnancy Prevention\n\nPatients of childbearing or child fathering potential must be willing to use a medically acceptable form of birth control, which includes abstinence, while being treated on this study.\n\nInformed Consent\n\nThe patient or parent/guardian can understand the consent and is willing to sign a written informed consent document according to institutional guidelines. Age- and developmentally appropriate assent should be obtained as required by institutional guidelines.\n\nPatients who meet eligibility criteria per Section 3.3.1.2.1 must be enrolled using Phase I treatment consent (Stratum 1).\nPatients who meet eligibility criteria per Section 3.3.1.2.2 must be enrolled using Surgical Study treatment consent (Stratum 2).\n\nTreatment Exclusion Criteria\n\nPatients with Bulky Tumors on Imaging Studies\n\nBulky tumors will be defined as those:\n\n> 6 cm in single maximum dimension, or\ntumor causing uncal herniation or mass effect leading to midline shift with or without symptoms or signs of impending herniation or\nobstruction to Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow.\nInfratentorial tumors with symptoms or signs arising from brain stem involvement by the tumor. Patients with stable cranial nerve deficit(s) secondary to prior surgery will not be excluded.\nSurgical Study (Stratum 2): Patients who have urgent need for surgical resection of tumor.\nPregnancy or Breast-feeding\n\nPregnant women or nursing mothers are excluded from this study.\n\na. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days of start of enrollment for treatment. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\n\nPregnant or breast-feeding women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events to the fetus or the nursing infant with the use of T cells genetically modified to express HER2 CAR. Pre-clinical studies in mice demonstrate the target antigen HER2 is necessary for normal fetal development of cardiac trabeculae, cranial sensory ganglia, and motor neuron development.75 Additionally, the lymphodepleting chemotherapy drugs fludarabine and cyclophosphamide are both Pregnancy Class D drugs.\n\n4. Concurrent Illness\n\nPatients with active autoimmune disease, documented history of autoimmune disease/syndrome, or any other condition that requires ongoing systemic steroids or systemic immunosuppressive agents, except a. Patients with vitiligo or resolved asthma/atopy b. Patients with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjogren's syndrome c. Patients requiring physiologic doses of corticosteroids (up to 0.5 mg/m2/day dexamethasone equivalent)\n\nHistory of or ongoing pneumonitis or significant interstitial lung disease\n\nOngoing or active uncontrolled infection\n\nPatients with any clinically significant unrelated systemic illness (serious infections or significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction), that in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate protocol therapy, put them at additional risk for toxicity or would interfere with the study procedures or results.\n\nPatients with any of the following cardiac diseases\n\nNew York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV\nClinically significant cardiac arrhythmia including, but not limited to, Torsade de pointes or requiring a pacemaker\nLeft ventricular ejection fraction below 50% as determined by echocardiography (ECHO)\n\nKnown HIV positivity\n\na. HIV-positive patients are ineligible due to the unknown safety and efficacy of infusing these patients with CAR T cells genetically modified using retroviral vectors. Additionally, the immunosuppression used for treatment in this study will pose an unacceptable risk.\n\n5. Concomitant Medications\n\nPatients who are receiving any other anti-cancer or investigational drug therapy are ineligible.\n\nPatients who have received the last vaccination of a live vaccine ≤ 30 days prior to enrollment are ineligible.\n\nExamples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines and must meet timeline for live vaccine.\n\nHerbal preparations/medications (except for vitamins) including, but not limited to: St. John's wort, Kava, ephedra (ma huang), gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), yohimbe, saw palmetto, black cohosh, and ginseng. Patients should stop using all herbal medications and dietary supplements at least 7 days prior to enrollment.\n\n6. Inability to participate\n\nPatients who in the opinion of the investigator are unwilling or unable to return for required follow-up visits or obtain follow-up studies required to assess toxicity to therapy or to adhere to drug administration plan, other study procedures, and study restrictions.\n\n7. Allergy\n\nPatients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition (murine protein-containing products, Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), or dextran 40).",
