      "BriefSummary": "RATIONALE: Placing a tumor antigen chimeric receptor that has been created in the laboratory into patient autologous or donor-derived T cells may make the body build immune response to kill cancer cells.\n\nPURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying genetically engineered lymphocyte therapy in treating patients with B-cell leukemia or lymphoma that is relapsed (after stem cell transplantation or intensive chemotherapy) or refractory to chemotherapy.",
      "DetailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nTo assess the efficacy of TanCAR19/20 T cells in relapsed or refractory NHL, defined as overall response rate (ORR).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of TanCAR19/20 T cells. II. To evaluate time to response (TTR), duration of overall response (DOR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).\n\nIII. To determine in vivo expansion and persistence of TanCAR19/20 T cells.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 group according to order of enrollment. Patients receive anti-CD19/20-CAR (coupled with CD137 and CD3 zeta signalling domains)vector-transduced autologous T cells on day1 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 3 months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 3 years."
