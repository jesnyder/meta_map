      "BriefSummary": "Background: Autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy (ARB) is one of 5 blinding eye diseases caused by mutations in the gene BEST1. These diseases, collectively termed \"bestrophinopathies\" include ARB, Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD), adult-onset vitelliform dystrophy (AVMD), autosomal dominant vitreoretinalchoroidopathy (ADVIRC) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP) .\n\nObjective: To collect DNA/RNA and skin samples from individuals with ARB or other diseases due to mutations in the gene BEST1. These models will be used to identify and test therapeutic approaches to treating these diseases.\n\nDesign: Study involves a one time donation of a skin punch biopsy and whole blood. Once the skin biopsy is obtained, skin fibroblasts will be isolated, which will be reprogrammed into iPSCs. RPE cells will be derived from the iPSCs",
      "DetailedDescription": "The PI on this proposal has been studying BEST1 and the protein encoded (Best1) since its discovery in 1998. Best1 is an integral membrane protein that in the eye is expressed only by retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells where it is localized to the basolateral plasma membrane.\n\nMethods: Once a subject has been identified as a potential candidate, a study coordinator will meet with the subject, to discuss the study prior to sample collection. The study coordinator will review the consent form with the subject and spend as much time as necessary answering any questions. Once the subject has signed the consent form, study procedures will begin.\n\nFollowing the consent process, a skin sample will be obtained from subjects using a (4mm) dermal punch biopsy method. This will be accomplished in a single visit to the Regenerative Medicine Consult Service or other approved clinical examination room. A suture may need to be placed following this skin biopsy. A health care provider (either at Mayo Clinic or a local health care provider's office) can remove the stitches, or the subject can remove them with a provided disposable suture removal kit.\n\nSubjects will also be asked to undergo venipuncture; all subjects will be asked to have the venipuncture and have the option to refuse. 10ml of blood will be collected for RNA and DNA extraction.\n\nOnce the skin biopsy is obtained,skin fibroblasts will be isolated, which will be reprogrammed into iPSCs. RPE cells will be derived from the iPSCs.\n\nRemuneration: If subjects make a special trip only for the research procedures, they may be reimbursed for travel expenses including: airfare, mileage, parking, and hotel. In order to receive reimbursement, they must provide a copy of the original receipts for those expenses. Reimbursement will not exceed $1000.00."
