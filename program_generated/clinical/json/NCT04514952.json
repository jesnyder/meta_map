      "BriefSummary": "The drug for this submission is Hope Biosciences' autologous, adipose-derived culture-expanded mesenchymal stem cells (HB-adMSCs) for the treatment of a single patient with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Stem cells have become a promising tool for the treatment of inflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions, including autoimmune diseases, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Once the eligibility is confirmed, approximately 1-2 weeks after the screening visit, the subject will return for the baseline/first infusion visit. Subsequent treatments will occur 2 weeks apart for 18 weeks, for a total of 10 infusions. Follow-up visits will occur at 22 weeks, 26 weeks and 39 weeks. End of study visit will occur at 52 weeks.\n\nBaseline/Infusion 1 Visit\n\nA verification of patient consent will be verbally performed and included in the progress note.\nReview of medical history, and concomitant medications.\nPhysical exam + ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R)\nVital signs (Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Respirations, Temp., SpO2)\nWeight measurement\n\nBlood samples will be collected for safety and efficacy assessments:\n\nHematology\nChemistry\nCoagulation Panel\nProinflammatory Cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, TNF-a)\nC- Reactive Protein (CRP)\n\nThe HB-adMSCs will be administered and the patient closely observed:\n\n• One intravenous infusion of HB-adMSCs (2x108 cells) to last 1 hour:\n\nVolume: 250 ml of Saline Solution 0.9%.\nRate: 83gts/min (250ml/h)\n\nThe subject will then be monitored for a minimum of 2hr after infusion as follows:\n\nMeasure Vital signs at minute 0 of infusion.\nMeasure Vital signs at minute 15 after IV infusion.\nMeasure Vital Signs at minute 30 after IV infusion.\nMeasure Vital signs at minute 60 after IV infusion.\nMeasure Vital signs at minute 120 after IV infusion. (Vital signs will be recorded more frequently if clinically indicated).\nAdverse event monitoring\n24 hrs. Telephone encounter. The subject will be contacted by telephone the following day after the infusion visit to determine if any adverse events have occurred.\nALS-specific Quality of Life Survey-revised (ALSSQOL-R)\nA video recording will be made with the purpose to capture patient's overall status (gait, range of motion assessments, etc.).\n\nOne week following infusion, PI will perform an assessment to determine patient status and discuss any changes since previous infusion.\n\nInfusion Visits Week 2,6,10,14 and 18\n\nReview and update medical history\nUpdate concomitant medications list\nWeight measurement\nVital signs (Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Respirations, Temp., SpO2)\nPhysical examination + ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R)\n\nThe HB-adMSCs will be administered and the patient closely observed:\n\n• One intravenous infusion of HB-adMSCs (2x108 cells) to last 1 hour:\n\nVolume: 250 ml of Saline Solution 0.9%.\nRate: 83gts/min (250ml/h)\nAdverse event monitoring\n24 hrs.

Telephone encounter. The subject will be contacted by telephone the following day after the infusion visit to determine if any adverse events have occurred.\n\nFollow-Up Visit Week 22\n\nYou will be asked about your current health and medical history (if any changes since last study visit or telephone call).\nYou will be asked if there was any change in the medication list you have previously provided (Concomitant medication list).\nYour blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, temperature, oxygen saturation and weight will be measured.\nThe doctor will perform a physical examination driven by the signs and/or symptoms you experience, if any.\nThe doctor will perform tests including the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) to measure the symptoms of ALS Disease on how you are able to perform.\nYou will be asked to complete the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis-Specific Quality of Life-Revised (ALSSQOL-R) questionnaire to assess the impact of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis on your quality of life.\nYou will be reminded to stay on your stable regimen of treatment throughout the study\n\nFollow-Up Visit Week 26\n\nYou will be asked about your current health and medical history.\nYou will be asked about the medicines that you have taken and are currently taking for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and for other health issues.\nYour blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, and weight will be measured.\nThe doctor will perform a complete physical examination.\nThe doctor will perform tests including the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) to measure the symptoms of ALS Disease on how you are able to perform.\nYou will be asked to complete the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis-Specific Quality of Life-Revised (ALSSQOL-R) questionnaire to assess the impact of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis on your quality of life.\nLaboratory test will be done. About 6 tablespoons of blood will be taken from your arm using a needle. Your blood will be tested to measure your overall health and efficacy markers (TNF-a, IL-6, IL-2 and C - Reactive Protein).\nYou will be given an order for a Chest X ray (PA single view) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging to be performed. If within 7 days of the End of study visit you have undergone any or both, such reports would suffice this requirement.\nAn Electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed to evaluate cardiac function.\nAn Electromyogram (EMG) will be performed to evaluate neuromuscular function.\nA video documenting of yourself walking and sitting will be performed.\n\nFollow-Up Visit Week 39\n\nYou will be asked about your current health and medical history (if any changes since last study visit or telephone call).\nYou will be asked if there was any change in the medication list you have previously provided (Concomitant medication list).\nYour blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, temperature, oxygen saturation and weight will be measured.\nThe doctor will perform a physical examination driven by the signs and/or symptoms you experience, if any.\nLaboratory test will be done.
