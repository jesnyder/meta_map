      "BriefSummary": "This is an open-label, one-arm single-center phase Ⅱa study exploring the efficacy and safety of CS20AT04 (HLA-haplo Matched Allogenic Bone Marrow-Derived Stem Cells) in two subpopulation group of systemic lupus erythematosus patients - lupus nephritis and lupus cytopenia.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause that can affect virtually every organ. A subset of SLE patients continues to suffer significant morbidity and mortality from active disease, with visceral organ involvement. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a more effective therapy for SLE disorder, especially for treatment-refractory patients.\n\nBone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells are known to be effective in modulating immune cells such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and Neutral Killer (NK) cells and treating acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD). Also, based on the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells have been widely studied as a candidate for the treatment of refractory immune- and inflammation-mediated disease, and have extensive experience of use.\n\nHalf-matched allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, the active ingredient of CS20AT04 Injection, not only have the potential to differentiate into various mesenchymal cells but also have various immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, and thus are expected to induce and maintain remission of lupus nephritis and lupus cytopenia.\n\nThis study is designed to investigate the following. Subjects enrolled into the CS20AT04 with corticosteroid taper regimen arm will receive two infusions of CS20AT04(2.0×10^6cell/kg), on 0 day and on 12 weeks post-enrollment. Subjects will return for efficacy and safety assessments on 3 days, 1 week, and every 4 weeks each post-infusion until Week 24. Safety monitoring will be continued at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years post-infusion."
