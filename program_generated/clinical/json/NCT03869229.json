Subjects will receive a single dose of at least 10 million of autologous Adipose-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (ADMCS) every three months for 12 months (maximum four doses in total and at least 40 million of ADMCS in total) via ultrasound guided intra-articular injection.",
      "DetailedDescription": "This phase I/II study will enroll 100 subjects with mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the hip/knee/ glenohumeral joint will be enrolled according to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. All patients will be selected and sign consent forms, then divided into 3 groups based on clinical presentation. Participants will be exposed to abdominal liposuction procedure under local anesthesia for adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSC) harvesting. Stem cells will be separated from fat cells in the adipose tissue then activated in the Polish Stem Cell Bank. The activated stem cells will be injected into the knee joint via 22G spinal needle. The intra-articular stem cells injections will be performed under ultrasound guidance at the theater under spinal anesthesia. Each patient will receive a single dose of at least 10 million of ADMSC in 3 mL of normal saline every three months for 12 months (maximum four doses in total and at least 40 million of ADMSC in total) via ultrasound guided intra-articular injection. During the study period and 24 months after last injection they will be followed by clinical assessment, laboratory investigations as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the injected joint. The local and systemic safety of the procedure and therapy with ADMSC will be also determined during study."
