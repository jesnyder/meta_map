      "BriefSummary": "This study is an extension to re-treat partial and non-responders from the previously approved Phase 1 MCS-AFP protocols IRB #12-009716 (Crohn's Disease perianal fistulas) and 15-003200 (cryptoglandular perianal fistulas).",
      "DetailedDescription": "This study is an extension to re-treat partial and non-responders from the previously approved Phase 1 MCS-AFP protocols IRB #12-009716 (Crohn's Disease perianal fistulas) and 15-003200 (cryptoglandular perianal fistulas). This study will enroll patients that have persistent symptomatic perianal disease despite being treated with an MSC coated fistula plug, and also treat patients that have had recurrence of their perianal fistula.\n\nAs per the previously approval treatment under IND 15356, patients will have a single affected fistula treated, which is the same fistula that was treated in the original protocol. The matrix for delivering the cells is a Gore Bio-A Fistula Plug.\n\nSubjects will be screened at outpatient clinic visits and interested qualified subjects will be offered participation in the trial and consented. At the first study visit (Visit 1; Screening visit), the patient will be evaluated and assessment will be made if an EUA is clinically necessary to assess the fistula. As this is a re-treatment trial, patients with incomplete response to initial plug placement typically have close follow up, recent MRI imaging, and may have a seton in place. If an EUA is clinically indicated, this would be by a colorectal surgeon for drainage of sepsis and placement of a seton as part of the standard clinical care for perianal fistula.\n\nPatients will return on: Day 1, Week 4, Week 12, and Week 24."
