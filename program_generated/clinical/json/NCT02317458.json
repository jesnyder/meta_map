Enrolled patients will be randomized on a 1:1 ratio to either standard of care and C3BS-CQR-1 injection (treatment group) or standard of care undergoing a sham procedure (control group). Patients randomized to the treatment group, for which C3BS-CQR-1 production met release criteria, will undergo endoventricular injection of the C3BS-CQR-1 using injection catheter."
