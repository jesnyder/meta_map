      "DetailedDescription": "This clinical trial is designed as a Phase 1/2a clinical trial targeting patients with critical limb ischemia. The trial is composed of Phase 1 to assess the tolerability and safety and Phase 2a to assess the safety and efficacy of the investigational product.\n\nPhase 1: Open-label, 3 + 3 design, single-center This phase is conducted in a 3 + 3 design by dose level to evaluate the tolerability of the investigational product.\n\nIf the subject voluntarily agrees signs the informed consent formin writing to participate in this clinical trial, the subjects who had necessary check-ups and tests and meet the inclusion criteria after subject conformity assessment are registered in the clinical trial.The subjects receive the investigational product once and are checked for adverse events through day 1 and then discharged. The safety and efficacy assessments are conducted through visits at week 4, week 12, and week 24 after administration.\n\nSubjects are evaluated for adverse events up to week 4 after the administration of the investigational product by registering 3 subjects each at the dosing phase. This evaluation is conducted according to the number of persons subjects who developed Grade 3 or higher adverse drug reactions (ADRs) according to CTCAE Version_5.0 in which a causal relation with the investigational product cannot be ruled out.\n\nIf the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined with the test group 2 (high dose) in the Phase 1 clinical trial, the Phase 2a clinical trial will be conducted with the two groups, test group 2 and test group 1.\n\nHowever, if adverse events occur in 1 of 6 subjects, the test group 2 will be decided considered as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), or but only the test group 1 will proceed to Phase 2a.\n\nIf adverse events occur in 2 or more subjects out of 6 subjects, a dose smaller than test group 1 (low dose) is determined to be the maximum tolerated dose. The Phase 2a clinical trial will not proceed and the clinical trial will end.\n\nPhase 2a: Open-label, sequential assignment, single-center If tolerability and safety are secured 4 weeks after administration of the investigational product of Phase 1, Phase 2a is conducted.\n\nOnly those subjects meeting the final inclusion criteria are sequentially assigned, admitted by the same procedure, and administered the investigational product once. Subjects are checked for adverse events through day 1 and discharged. Safety and efficacy assessments are performed at week 4, week 12, and week 24 after administration. All subjects are tested with the same schedule, excluding their doses.\n\nThe subjects enrolled in Phase 1 are analyzed for efficacy through visits at week 12 and week 24 so that all subjects (Phase 1 and Phase 2a) are assessed and analyzed for efficacy."
