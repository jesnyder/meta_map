Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada), Cladribine (NDA submitted), Natalizumab (Tysabri), S1P modulators (Gilenya) are excluded for safety reasons due to the known risk of systemic autoimmune disease, malignancy, opportunistic infections, and cardiovascular toxicity associated with these therapies, as well as theoretical effects on MSC-NTF cell homing and migration, that may be associated with Natalizumab and/or S1P modulators (Gilenya).\nAny history of acquired or inherited immune deficiency syndrome.\nAny history of either substance abuse within the past year, or unstable psychiatric disease according to the Investigator's judgment.\nPregnant women or women currently breastfeeding.\nSubjects for whom MRI is contraindicated (i.e., have a pacemaker or other metallic implanted device, or are unable to remain in the machine for period of time needed to acquire a scan.",
