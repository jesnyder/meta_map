MSCs have shown the ability to find injured tissue, reduce and control inflammation, and assist in tissue repair.\n\nProchymal™ MSCs will be infused into patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. Infusions will occur on two separate days, 7-10 days apart. Patients will be monitored for reduced Crohn's disease symptoms.",
