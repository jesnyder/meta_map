      "BriefSummary": "To investigate safety of treatment with allogeneic adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASCs) in patients undergoing lung transplantation, to evaluate whether the treatment can reduce host immunological reaction towards the graft, and to reduce the ischemic reperfusion-injury after transplantation.",
      "DetailedDescription": "The emerging field of stem cell therapy holds promise of treating a variety of diseases. Especially the mesenchymal stromal cells from bone marrow (BMSCs) or adipose tissue (ASCs) have proven their potential for regenerative therapy in patients with ischemic heart disease. Both of these cell types have putative immunomodulatory properties, as they have demonstrated to actively suppress the immune system and hereby evade recognition.\n\nThis knowledge will be transferred into studies in the ischemic reperfusion-injury/primary lung graft dysfunction in lung transplantation, and in suppressing the initial host immunological response towards the transplanted lung where a high degree of immunological and inflammatory activity is involved.\n\nWe will conduct a clinical trial in which patients receiving lung transplantation will be randomized to either placebo or treatment with allogeneic MSCs from adipose tissue. The aim is to assess the impact of MSCs on primary graft dysfunction.\n\nThe perspective is that this new information can be of pivotal importance and potentially be a paradigm shift for the clinical problems seen in the first period after lung transplantation and reduce the long-term graft rejection and dysfunction."
