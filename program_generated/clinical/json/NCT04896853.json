      "BriefSummary": "The investigators hypothesise that the systemic delivery of Wharton's Jelly (WJ)-Umbilical Cord (UC) Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC), WJ-MSCs exerts an anti-inflammatory action and anti-apoptotic effect in the lung of COVID-19 patients. The nature of these cells to immunomodulate both tissue resident and bloodborne immune cells towards a more anti-inflammatory and tolerogenic profile, results in a reduction of tissue-based inflammation within the lung and triggering of repair responses. This clinically culminates in a beneficial action on patients with respiratory complications associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection."
