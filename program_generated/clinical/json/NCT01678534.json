Patients with a score of 2 or more in the item 1a of the NIHSS related to the degree of awareness.\nEvidence on neuroimaging (CT or MRI) of brain tumour, cerebral oedema with midline shift and clinically significant compression of ventricles, cerebellar infarction or brainstem, or intraventricular, intracerebral or subarachnoid haemorrhage.\nCurrent drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.· Active infectious disease, including HIV, hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, etc.\nPre-existing dementia.\nSpecify health status or any clinical conditions (e.g., life expectancy, co-existing disease) or other characteristics that precludes appropriate diagnosis, treatment or follow-up in the trial.\nPatients who are participating in another clinical trial.\nInability or unwillingness of individual or legal guardian/representative to give written informed consent.",
