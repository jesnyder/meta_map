The study purpose is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of five IV infusions of HB-adMSCs in subjects with no signs of COVID-19.",
      "DetailedDescription": "This is a Phase II, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blinded, Clinical Trial to Assess Efficacy of HB-adMSCs to Provide Immune Support Against Coronavirus Disease. 100 patients will be enrolled. Eligible participants are at high or very high exposure risk of contracting COVID-19. The primary endpoint of this study is to provide immune support against COVID-19, measured by the percentage of subjects that develop symptoms of COVID-19. In addition, participants will be monitored for overall clinical status by standard clinical laboratories and inflammatory markers. Participants will complete Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and depression module (PHQ-9) questionnaires."
