      "BriefSummary": "The aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of AloCELYVIR, which consist in bone marrow-derived allogenic mesenchymal stem cells infected with an oncolytic Adenovirus, ICOVIR-5. It has recently been proven that this type of cells are able of transporting oncolytic substances to tumor targets that are difficult to reach, such as medulloblastomas and gliomas, youth cancers located in the cranial cavity that have a poor prognosis and a fatal outcome. In addition, to exerting an anti-tumor action, this virus has the ability to stimulate the immune response, making the therapy even more effective. Thus, the diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma and the medulloblastoma in relapse/progression have been chosen to study the potential of this new advanced therapy through a weekly infusion for 8 weeks."
