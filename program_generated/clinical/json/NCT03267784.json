      "BriefSummary": "The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the efficacy (by monitoring the wound surface area reduction of Diabetic Foot Ulcers) and safety (by monitoring adverse events) of two doses of the allogeneic investigational medicinal product \"allo-APZ2-DFU\" topically administered to the wound matrix of patients with diabetic neuropathic ulcer.",
      "DetailedDescription": "This is an interventional, single arm, phase I/IIa clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of allogeneic ABCB5-positive mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on wound healing in patients with diabetic neuropathic ulcer. Allogeneic MSCs will be isolated ex vivo and will be expanded in vitro. The Investigational medicinal product (IMP) containing the ABCB5-positive MSCs will then be applied two times (at Visit 3 and six weeks later, at Visit 10) on the wound surface of DFU.\n\nPatients are followed up for efficacy for a period of three months starting after the first IMP application which allows to distinguish actual wound healing from transient wound coverage.\n\nThe wound healing process will be documented by standardized photography. The wound size reduction evaluation will start two weeks after the first IMP application. The quality of the wound healing process will be assessed on the basis of formation of granulation tissue, epithelialization and wound exudation.\n\nPain will be assessed using a numerical rating scale and quality of life will be investigated with standardized and validated questionnaires. To assess long-term safety of allo-APZ2-DFU three follow-up visits at Months 6, 9 and 12 after the first IMP application are included."
