      "BriefSummary": "Poor incision healing is a common complication after abdominal surgery, mainly manifested as incision dehiscence, subcutaneous fat liquefaction, malnutrition, and incision infection. Poor healing of the incision will increase the patient's pain and prolong the patient's hospital stay, and the choice of wound treatment is closely related to the wound healing effect. Mesenchymal stem cells mainly rely on paracrine effects to exert their therapeutic effects and obtain better therapeutic effects in wound healing. Here, the pleiotropic factors secreted from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-PFs) will be used to treat patients with poor healing after surgery to evaluate its effectiveness and safety."
