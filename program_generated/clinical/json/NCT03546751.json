      "BriefSummary": "Using a prospective observational approach and a clinical trial design comparing the effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure to diet and exercise, investigators plan to evaluate how obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) leads to endothelial dysfunction in adolescents and young adults and whether treatment of OSA can improve endothelial dysfunction. Concurrently, investigators will measure miR 92a/miR 210 levels in all subjects at baseline and following therapy to determine whether miR 92a/miR 210 levels reliably predict endothelial dysfunction in patients and responses to therapy.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Investigators will randomize 100 OSA patients (age 13-21) to receive either continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) plus baseline diet/exercise (n=50) or medical management (intensive diet and exercise; n=50). Only children in whom adenotonsillectomy is contraindicated (morbid obesity, history of adenotonsillectomy, lack of adenotonsillar hypertrophy) will be included. Investigators will conduct a randomized prospective comparative effectiveness study to assess the impact of treatment on OSA on endothelial function (peripheral arterial tonometry-EndoPAT). In addition to diagnostic polysomnography and EndoPAT at baseline, EV (extracellular vesicle) and non EV derived miR 92a/miR 210 concentrations, inflammatory cytokines concentrations, and body anthropometry will be measured. Following 3 mos of therapy and after 6mos of therapy, investigators will re-evaluate EndoPAT, EV and non EV derived miR 92a/miR 210 concentrations, inflammatory cytokines, and body anthropometry.\n\nThroughout the study, investigators will maintain weekly telephone contact and monthly face-to-face visits as per standard of care in both groups to ensure ongoing success. In the medical management group (intensive diet and exercise), diet and exercise will be tracked by maintaining weekly telephone contact and monthly face-to-face visits with a registered dietician. For the CPAP group, investigators will also maintain weekly telephone contact and monthly face-to-face visits with a sleep technician to review mask fitting, and adherence reports, to optimize adherence to CPAP therapy.\n\nFollowing completion at six months, polysomnography will be repeated."
