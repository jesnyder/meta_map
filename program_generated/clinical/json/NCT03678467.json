This first in human trial is designed specifically to assess the safety of EB-CMF clinically. Although secondary measures of graft efficacy are being assessed, the primary focus will be on Adverse Events stemming from graft implantation."

Patients must provide written informed consent and authorization for use and disclosure of protected health information.\nA healthy condyle which can be plated with titanium plates and screws.\nA mandibular continuity ramus defect which starts below the sigmoid notch and extends only as far as but not including the angle.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nUncontrolled alcohol, tobacco, or substance abuse within 6 months prior to implantation.\nMandibular ramus defects with open wounds.\nDefects > 15 cc in volume.\nDefects > 6 cm in diameter.\nSystemic disease that would render the fat harvest and product implantation, along with associated anesthesia, unsafe to the patient.\nPatient has any underlying or current medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would impact patient safety or interfere with the integrity of the study data.\nActive uncontrolled infection or malignancy. Patients will be allowed to undergo rescreening once, after the infection is cleared, if they are willing to do so.\nPatients with signs and symptoms of infection between Screening and up to the surgical implantation.\nRadiation therapy < 6 months prior to the surgical implantation.\nNeed for soft tissue reconstruction (flap, skin graft, etc).\nConditions that may impact the success of the surgical implantation or increase the risk of postoperative complications, including inherited coagulopathies like hemophilia, Von Willebrand's disease, protein C and S deficiency, thrombocythemias, thallassemias, sickle cell disease, etc.\nConditions that may impact functional outcomes, including uncontrolled diabetes, osteoporosis, rare disorders of bone healing like osteopetrosis, or any other metabolic bone disease.\nIncreased alkaline phosphatase (to exclude Paget's disease), increased serum calcium (to exclude hyperparathyroidism), or Vitamin D deficiency, at Screening, confirmed by a repeat test.\nOral bisphosphonate < 12 weeks, intravenous bisphosphonate < 12 months prior to Screening or use of systemic steroids or anabolic agents (e.g. teriparatide) for osteoporosis treatment.\nPatients with inadequate donor sites for lipoaspirate of adipose tissue.\nMixed connective tissue diseases and collagen diseases which can result in poor wound healing after surgery.\nPatients considered unsuitable per the consulted surgeon.\n\nPatient has any of the following conditions as identified by medical history:\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (active or seropositive).\nActive tuberculosis.\nActive hepatitis B infection.\nHepatitis C.\nViral encephalitis.\nToxoplasmosis. In case of doubt regarding mentioned conditions based on the physical examination or other signs or symptoms present at Screening, the patient will be asked to consent to additional testing to rule out such conditions or the patient must be excluded from the study.\nDonation of blood and blood products is not permitted from Screening and for at least 3 months after the surgical implantation.\nPatient participated in another clinical study of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives of the investigational drug (whichever is longer) prior to the surgical implantation or is currently participating in another clinical study of an investigational drug or intending to participate in another clinical study of an investigational drug before completion of all scheduled evaluations in this clinical study.\nPatients who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are not likely to complete the study for whatever reason.\nThe Investigator or any sub-investigator, research assistant, surgeon, study coordinator, or other staff directly involved in the conduct of the clinical study or any of their relatives.\nHypersensitivity to any product of bovine origin.\nHypersensitivity to gentamicin or other aminoglycosides.\nPost-menopausal women who have an abnormally low bone mineral density or have not tested for bone mineral density.\nPatients with discontinuity defects of the ramus.\nPatients with a history of malignant cancer.\nHypersensitivity or allergy to epinephrine or other drugs commonly used during surgery.",
