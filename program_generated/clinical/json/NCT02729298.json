      "BriefSummary": "TP-0903 is a novel oral inhibitor that targets AXL kinase and reverses the mesenchymal phenotype associated with advanced cancers. Preclinical studies have shown promising antitumor activity of TP-0903 as a single agent against a variety of tumor types in both in vitro and in vivo studies.\n\nThis first-in-human Phase 1a study is conducted to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TP-0903 administered orally to patients with advanced solid tumors and to identify the safety profile and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of TP-0903. Once the MTD has been established, additional patients with specific tumor types (advanced solid tumors that have progressed after achieving a best documented response of at least stable disease (ie, SD, PR, or CR documented per iRECIST following at least 2 cycles (8 weeks) of immunotherapy, EGFR+ Non Small Cell Lung Cancer [NSCLC] and have demonstrated recent progression following a best documented response of at least stable disease (ie, SD, PR, or CR documented per RECIST v1.1 on ≤2 lines of oral TKIs (Prior chemotherapy ± immunotherapy is allowed as long as the patient is clearly demonstrating current progression on an EGFR TKI.), BRAF-, KRAS-, or NRAS-mutated Colorectal Carcinoma [CRC] for whom there is no standard therapy remaining, persistent/recurrent Ovarian Cancer who would be platinum refractory/ resistant and have had any number of lines of prior therapy, and BRAF-mutated Melanoma that has not responded to immunotherapy or a combination BRAF/MEK inhibitor) will be enrolled at the MTD in the Phase 1b study. Data collected from patients enrolled in each of these additional cohorts will be used for to confirm safety, explore potential biomarkers, and evaluate potential signals of activity when TP-0903 is administered to specific groups of heavily pretreated patients or given in combination with immunotherapy or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).\n\nThe study will investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumor activity profiles.",
      "DetailedDescription": "This is a phase 1a / 1b, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic study of TP-0903 administered once daily for the first 21 out of 28 days.\n\nThere are 2 phases in this study. In Phase 1a (dose escalation), sequential cohorts of three (3) patients will be treated with escalated doses until the MTD is established. In the absence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), the dose will be increased using a modified Fibonacci dose escalation scheme.\n\nOnce the MTD has been established, dosing will change from BSA-dependent to a flat dose based on the average of the dose administered in the MTD expansion safety cohort. Once the MTD has been established, in Ph 1b (expansion), 5 additional cohorts of up to 20 patients each with specific tumor types (up to 100 additional patients total) may be enrolled at the MTD dose level to confirm safety, explore potential biomarkers, and evaluate potential signals of activity when TP-0903 is administered to specific groups of heavily pretreated patients or given in combination with immunotherapy or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Ten patients in each of these 5 Expansion Cohorts will be required to consent to undergo pre- and post-dose tumor biopsies. All patients who undergo these biopsies will comprise the 'Biopsy Cohorts' (Phase 1b).\n\nPatients who successfully complete a 4-week treatment cycle without evidence of significant treatment-related toxicity or progressive disease will be permitted to continue to receive treatment with the same dose and dosing schedule."
