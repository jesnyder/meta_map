      "BriefSummary": "To determine the safety of single and repeated intravenous doses of hCT-MSC in newborn infants with HIE.",
      "DetailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of one and two intravenous infusions of human umbilical cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hCT-MSC), the first administered in the first 48 postnatal hours, and the second at two months postnatal age, in term and near term infants with moderate to severe neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). This is a phase I, prospective, open-label trial designed to assess the safety of one or two intravenous doses of hCT-MSC in newborn infants with moderate to severe HIE who are recipients of therapeutic hypothermia. Infants born at 36 0/7 weeks gestation or later who have moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and are receiving therapeutic hypothermia will be eligible to participate. Investigators project an accrual of 6 patients. All infants will receive intravenous infusion(s) of hCT-MSCs. The first cohort of three infants will receive a single dose in the first 48 postnatal hours. If there are no safety concerns, the second cohort of three infants will receive two doses, with the first dose given in the first 48 postnatal hours and the second dose given approximately two months after the first dose.\n\nThe potential risks associated with infusion of MSCs include a reaction to the product (rash, shortness of breath, wheezing, difficulty breathing, hypotension, swelling around the mouth, throat or eyes, tachycardia, diaphoresis), transmission of infection, and HLA sensitization. Another risk of this study is loss of confidentiality or privacy. Every effort will be made to keep the infant's medical record confidential. The results will be summarized using descriptive statistics and statistical testing as appropriate. Continuous secondary endpoints will be summarized using mean, standard deviation, CV%, median, minimum, and maximum."
