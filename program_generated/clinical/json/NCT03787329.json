      "BriefSummary": "This study aims to evaluate the effect of bone marrow concentration on avascular necrosis of femur head by comparing clinical and imaging outcomes between patients receiving core decompression surgery with intraoperative bone marrow concentration and those receiving core decompression surgery only.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Avascular necrosis (AVN) of femoral head is a progressive disease that predominantly affects younger patients. Although the exact pathophysiology of AVN has not yet to be elucidated, the disease is characterized by a vascular insult to the blood supply of the femoral head, which can lead to collapse of the femoral head and subsequent degenerative changes. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent cells that can differentiate into multiple mesenchymal tissues, including tenocytes, chondrocytes and osteoblasts, as well as being a source of multiple growth factors to establish an environment conducive to soft and hard tissue regeneration. As bone marrow concentration has high concentration of mesenchymal stem cells, several studies have applied the autologous bone marrow concentration in halting the progression of AVN of femoral head. However, a higher level of evidence for its use on patients suffering from femoral head avascular necrosis has not been reported. This clinical trial will evaluate and compare the eligible patients who undertake core decompression surgery plus intraoperative bone marrow concentration with those who received core decompression surgery only. All patients will be followed for one year and clinical and imaging outcomes will be compared and analyzed."
