      "BriefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the side effects of genetically modified T cells and decitabine in treating patients with recurrent or refractory epithelial or non-epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that has come back or has not responded to previous treatments. White blood cells called T cells are collected via a process called leukapheresis, genetically modified to recognize and attack tumor cells, then given back to the patient. Decitabine may induce and increase the amount of the target protein NY-ESO-1 available on the surface of tumor cells. Giving genetically modified T cells and decitabine may kill more tumor cells.",
      "DetailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the safety and tolerability of the autologous NY-ESO-1 redirected T cell therapy in combination with decitabine and low-dose IL-2 in patients with treatment refractory or recurrent epithelial or non-epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube carcinoma.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the persistence of genetically modified cells in the peripheral blood, and at tumor sites.\n\nII. To examine the effect of the treatment on tumor as measured by objective tumor response and progression free survival, both assessed by immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST).\n\nIII. To assess the occurrence of target antigen and/or major histocompatibality complex (MHC) loss variants upon disease recurrence.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the post treatment phenotype and functionality of genetically modified T cells isolated from peripheral blood and from tumor sites.\n\nII. To assess changes in immunoscore, Tregs, Myeloid cell subsets, and antigen spreading in peripheral blood and tumor site.\n\nIII. To assess the influence of demographic and disease molecular characteristics on treatment outcomes of complete response (CR) and overall survival (OS).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nCOURSE 1: Patients receive decitabine IV daily over 1 hour on days -8 to Day -6, cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -4 and -3, and genetically engineered NY-ESO-1-specific T lymphocytes IV and intraperitoneally (IP) on day 0. Followed by low-dose IL-2 for 2 weeks from Day 1 to Day 14..\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly at 3-9 months, every 6 months for 4 years, and then annually for up to 15 years."
