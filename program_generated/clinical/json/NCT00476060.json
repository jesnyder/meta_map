      "BriefSummary": "The standard treatment for decompensated cirrhosis is liver transplantation, however, it has several limitations. Recent animal studies suggest that bone marrow stem cell transplantation can lead to regression of liver fibrosis. The investigators have already completed the phase 1 study of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation in 4 patients with cirrhosis. The procedure was safe, and feasible, and led to somewhat promising results (Mohamadnejad M, et al. 2006; Submitted for publication). The aim of this study is to find efficacy of this new treatment strategy in the setting of a multicenter, randomized placebo-controlled trial in 50 patients with decompensated cirrhosis.",
      "DetailedDescription": "The standard treatment for decompensated cirrhosis is liver transplantation, however, it has several limitations, including small donor pool, long waiting list, and several complications. Recent animal studies suggest that bone marrow stem cell transplantation can lead to regression of liver fibrosis. The investigators have already completed the phase 1 study of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation in 4 patients with cirrhosis. The procedure was safe, and feasible, and led to somewhat promising results (Mohamadnejad M, et al. 2006; Submitted for publication). The aim of this study is to find efficacy of this new treatment strategy in the setting of a multicenter, randomized placebo controlled trial. After assignment of the written informed consent, thirty six patients with decompensated cirrhosis will be enrolled, and will be randomized by block randomization into treatment or placebo arm. All the enrolled patients will be in the waiting list of liver transplantation. In the treatment arm bone marrow of the patients will be aspirated, and autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells will be cultured, and then will be infused through a peripheral vein. Also, the corresponding placebo will be infused for the placebo group. The patients will be followed up for 1 year after performing the procedure."
