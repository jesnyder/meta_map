      "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to analyze the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell transplantation through percutaneous injection in patients with chronic spinal cord injury.",
      "DetailedDescription": "This is a pilot, open, phase I study, in a prospective cohort. The study population will consist of 5 patients who had spinal cord injury for at least 6 months, with complete paraplegia.\n\nA practitioner, a neurosurgeon and a nurse will review the medical records of patients to determine the presence / absence of inclusion / exclusion criteria. If the patient is a potential candidate for the study, an interview will be scheduled with the patient to review and confirm his/her eligibility. If the clinical eligibility is confirmed, the patient will undergo psychosocial evaluation to determine the degree of emotional equilibrium and conditions for participation in the study.\n\nPatients will undergo a series of clinical and neurological evaluations and will also be submitted to the following procedures:\n\nCell blood count;\nBiochemical analysis (measurement of electrolytes - sodium, potassium, magnesium);\nRenal function tests (urea and creatinine);\nLiver function tests;\nCoagulation profile;\nMetabolic profile (glucose, total cholesterol and fractions);\nUrine summary and culture;\nSerology required for blood transfusion and marrow transplant in Brasil;\nElectrocardiogram;\nChest X-Ray, X-ray of knees;\nBone densitometry;\nUrodynamic studies;\nSomatosensory evoked potential;\nComputed tomography of thoracic and lumbar spine;\nMRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine.\n\nAlso as part of the preoperative evaluation, the patients will respond to questions from the SF (Short Form) -36 questionnaire (for assessment of quality of life) and the questionnaires for the assessment of neuropathic pain.\n\nClinical follow-up will be kept for patients who suspend their participation in the study for any adverse event and / or laboratory abnormality, or for the patient's own desire, following insurance protocols. In addition to the clinical and surgical follow-up, specific medical care will be offered to patients who experience adverse events, until stabilization of the patient, even if the target date for completion of the study has been exceeded.\n\nThe candidates included in the study will be asked to voluntarily participate and give their informed written consent. Patients will be recruited for a minimum period of 06 months to follow up with additional laboratory and clinical examinations."
