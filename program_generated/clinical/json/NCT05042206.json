      "BriefSummary": "This clinical trial is an open, single-center, phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety of allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell injection in patients with chronic kidney disease.\n\nThe purpose is to evaluate the safety for 12 months after administration of Cellgram-CKD 3 times in 10 patients with chronic kidney disease.",
      "DetailedDescription": "The screening test is performed after the clinical trial subject consents in writing to participate in the clinical trial.\n\nSubjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria are registered in the clinical trial, and Cellgram-CKD is injected intravenously by puncturing a vein with a needle. After injecting Cellgram-CKD three times at an interval of 2 weeks (14 days), the subject visits the testing institution at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months for safety evaluation.\n\nHowever, since the safety of Cellgram-CKD has not been established, proceed as follows.\n\nIn the first 3 subjects who received the investigational product, if no adverse events of Grade 3 or higher according to the NCI-CTCAE related to the investigational product occur 14 days after the 1st and 2nd administration, and 1 month after the 3rd administration, the remaining subjects were sequentially treated. Register as a member and conduct clinical trials.\n\nIf an adverse event of Grade 3 or higher according to the NCI-CTCAE standard related to the test drug occurs in two of the first three subjects, the clinical trial is terminated early. is conducted by registering three additional test subjects in the same way as the first.\n\nIf one or more of the three subjects develops a Grade 3 or higher adverse event related to the investigational product, the clinical trial is terminated early, and the remaining subjects are treated only if all three subjects do not have a Grade 3 or higher adverse reaction related to the investigational product. Register to continue the clinical trial."
