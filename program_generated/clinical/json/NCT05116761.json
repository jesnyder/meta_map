(Of note: EQ-5D-5L has 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression. Each dimension is scored from 1 (full) to 5 (worst), such that a score of 11111 is reflective of full quality-of-life and a score of 55555 is reflective of worst quality-of-life.)\nBaseline 6-Minute Walk Test (6-MWT) is 500 meters or less.\nSupplemental oxygen should be ≤5 L O2/min.\nIf the candidate is either male or female of reproductive potential, he or she must agree to use of double barrier method of highly effective birth control contraception such as condoms with oral contraceptive pill or choose to remain abstinent if already practicing abstinence during the screening period. The duration of required usage of double barrier method OR maintenance of abstinence must include the time from the beginning of the screening period until 90 days following the last dose of the study treatment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nVulnerable populations such as pregnant patients, children, individuals with severe physical or mental disabilities who cannot provide meaningful consent.\nActive malignancy requiring treatment within the last five years.\nMajor physical trauma in the last 3 months, including motor vehicle accidents, assaults, mechanical falls with sequelae of significant bleeding or craniofacial bruising, and surgeries.\nPatients with persistent symptoms due to any of the following chronic comorbidities such as active tuberculosis or cystic fibrosis, chronic respiratory disease including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pulmonary fibrosis requiring baseline home oxygen > 5 L O2/min, history of unstable angina or a heart attack during the last 12 months, pulmonary hypertension, hepatic impairment, chronic kidney disease, uncontrolled diabetes, substance abuse, severe osteoarthritis, HIV, migraine disorder, fibromyalgia, dementia, connective tissue disorders, and endocrine disorders.\nDepression as screened by positive Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ2) and confirmed as moderate or higher severity on PHQ9 (See Appendix 11.5). Of note, subjects found to have moderate or higher on PHQ-9 will be referred for appropriate outpatient psychiatric evaluation and intervention for their depression.\nVital sign abnormalities: temperature ≥ 38 °C, temperature < 35 °C; systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90 mmHg, SBP ≥ 170 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 50 mmHg, DBP ≥ 100 mmHg; heart rate (HR) < 50 beats per minute (BPM), HR ≥ 120 BPM.\nLab abnormalities: WBC ≥ 12,000 /μL, Creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL, AST ≥ 100 IU/l, and/or ALT ≥ 100 IU/I\nPatients who require rolling walker or wheelchair or higher level of assistance for ambulation.",
