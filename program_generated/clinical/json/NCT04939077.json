      "DetailedDescription": "This study is an exploratory clinical study to observe the improvement of heart function before and after the treatment by human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells, and the purpose is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of heart failure. The study is a randomized parallel controlled study. The research process is as follows: 1. Twenty eligible patients with ischemic heart disease were recruited, fully informed, and signed a consent form, and randomly divided into CABG group (n=10) or CABG + stem cell treatment group (n=10); 2. CABG was performed under general anesthesia in both groups. In the cell therapy group, 1×10^7 human umbilical cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells were injected to the edge of the myocardial infarction area at 20 points at the same time in CABG; 3. Use vasoactive drugs and antibiotics to prevent infection one week after surgery. After the operation, before discharge, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months after discharge, and once a year thereafter, until the death of the patient. Patients receive a review of which main content includes symptom improvement, cardiac function improvement, and adverse events."
