      "BriefSummary": "The goal of this study is to establish if mesenchymal stem cell augmentation improves graft incorporation and to analyze the cytokine environment of the joint after osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA) with and without intra-articular bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) injection. Information learned from this study can be used to biochemically compare treatment response and to assess emerging therapeutic options that may positively alter the biochemical environment in patients who suffer from articular cartilage disorders.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Articular cartilage injuries in the knee continue to grow in number as detection and treatment options have advanced. Treatment options, including microfracture, autologous chondrocyte (cells that make cartilage) implantation, osteochondral grafting and meniscus transplantation can hopefully deter the progression of degeneration and have promise to function as disease modifying solutions. Osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA) has emerged as a preferred method of treating large focal chondral defects as it structurally replaces the cartilage and often involved sub-chondral bone with native hyaline cartilage and bone. The results of OCA are successful with greater than 85% survival at 5-year follow-up. Failure can occur due to a lack of boney integration or low chondrocyte viability. Therefore, anything to enhance the graft augmentation process may be useful in preventing failure. The purpose of this prospective, randomized study is to determine the effect of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) containing bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells on improving graft incorporation and preventing failure. The effect of BMAC on the graft and intra-articular knee environment will be evaluated using 3 techniques: computed tomography (CT) imaging, synovial fluid cytokine analysis, and serum biomarker analysis. Information learned from this study can be used to biochemically compare treatment response and to assess emerging therapeutic options that may positively alter the biochemical environment in patients undergoing osteochondral allograft transplantation."
