      "DetailedDescription": "A prospective, single arm, open label, multi-center, phase II study of autologous T cells engineered against both CD19 and CD20 antigens for subjects with relapsed or refractory DLBCL after receiving at least two lines of therapy. The investigational agent is the MB-CART2019.1 cells. After successful screening, subjects will undergo leukapheresis to collect product for manufacturing. In preparation for the fresh product infusion, subjects will undergo a lymphodepleting regimen with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. Cell infusion will be administered intravenously at a dose of 2.5 x 106 CAR+ cells/kg body weight. The study will start with enrollment of 3 subjects in the lead-in safety phase, and after safety is evaluated, the study will continue with enrollment of the remaining subjects. Subjects will be followed for up to 2 years, for efficacy and safety outcomes as well as health-related quality of life (HRQol). Additional long-term follow-up will be conducted for participants under a separate long-term follow-up protocol."
