      "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of autologous Adipose Tissue derived Mesenchymal stem cells (JOINTSTEMÂ®) in patient with severe Knee Osteoarthritis.",
      "DetailedDescription": "JOINTSTEM is injectables for an OA treatment that uses autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells. As it does not use allogenic tissues and is cultured without additional genetic modification, it is classified as 'autologous cell therapy' and is completely free of immunologic rejection.\n\nIt primarily aims to improve joint function. The intra-articular injection of JOINTSTEM is expected to stimulate the regeneration of cartilage, and to innovatively improve joint function with cartilage regeneration.\n\nThe subjects of this therapy were patients with K&L grade 3 aged 20 or older.\n\nThis study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled study with two arms to evaluate JOINTSTEM as a treatment for subjects with osteoarthritis. Following a 2-week screening period, approximately 260 patients will be randomly assigned into one of the following two arms in a 1:1 ratio (1 JointStem : 1 placebo control). After each patient completes 6-month visit (Visit 5) and the data management team confirms all data have no issue, the individual database will be locked and the blinding will be open for the statistical analysis."
