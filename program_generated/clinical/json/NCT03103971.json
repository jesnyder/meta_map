      "BriefSummary": "This phase I trial studies the side effects of huJCAR014 in treating patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. huJCAR014 CAR-T cells are made in the laboratory by genetically modifying a patient's T cells and may specifically kill cancer cells that have a molecule CD19 on their surfaces.\n\nIn Stage 1, dose-finding studies will be conducted in 3 cohorts:\n\nAggressive B cell NHL\nLow burden ALL\nHigh burden ALL\n\nIn Stage 2, studies may be conducted in one or more cohorts to collect further safety, PK, and efficacy information at the huJCAR014 dose level(s) selected in Stage 1 for the applicable cohort(s). There are two separate cohorts for stage 2:\n\nCohort 2A, CAR-na√Øve (n=10): patients who have never received CD19 CAR-T cell therapy.\nCohort 2B, CAR-exposed (n=27): patients who have previously failed CD19 CAR-T cell therapy.",
      "DetailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate preliminary safety of autologous human anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-4-1BB-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocytes (huJCAR014) in adult patients with CD19+ relapsed or refractory (R/R) aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of huJCAR014 in CD19+ R/R aggressive B-cell NHL and ALL.\n\nII. To assess the antitumor activity of huJCAR014 in CD19+ R/R aggressive NHL and ALL.\n\nIII. To estimate the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with CD19+ R/R aggressive NHL and ALL treated with huJCAR014.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the cellular and humoral immune responses to huJCAR014. II. To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of huJCAR014. III. To assess the effect of huJCAR014 product attributes on safety, PK, and antitumor activity.\n\nIV. To assess the effect of tumor and tumor microenvironment on huJCAR014 PK and biomarkers.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of huJCAR014.\n\nPatients undergo leukapheresis. Beginning 1-2 weeks after leukapheresis, patients undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy comprising either cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) daily for 1 day and fludarabine IV daily for 3 days or cyclophosphamide and fludarabine IV daily for 3 days. Within 36-96 hours after completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, patients receive huJCAR014 IV over 20-30 minutes on day 0.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 30 days for the first 3 months, every 3 months for up to 12 months, and then yearly for 15 years."
