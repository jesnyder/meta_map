The planned interventions are collection of biological samples at different times. The study will aim to do a descriptive analysis of omics profiles evolution (tumor, volatile organic components) over time, before and after disease progression under Palbociclib treatment with a clinical-biological database.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Patients enrolled in the study will receive the following interventions:\n\nBiospecimen sample collection: before and during treatment, and at progression\nTumor biopsy before treatment and at progression\n\nThe aim of this study is to describe molecular changes associated with resistance to Palbociclib at the individual level and describe longitudinal changes in the profile of tumor, VOCs and exosomes according to treatment response.\n\nOther objectives of the study include:\n\nProportion of single or shared molecular alterations / signatures between patients at progression time\nAssociations between tumor signatures, VOCs and exosomes\nCompare molecular changes identified by proteomics with those observed by genomics / transcriptomics\nCompare the evolution of VOCs and exosomes over time with evolution of liquid biopsy markers."
