      "DetailedDescription": "The proposed study will assess primarily safety and secondary efficacy endpoints of allogeneic UC-MSC administered to 20 patients with disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)-resistant Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) who have been non-responsive to at least one course of one DMARD selected from a group comprising of: gold salts, leflunomide, methotrexate, and hydroxychloroquine.\n\nThe primary objective of safety will be defined as freedom from treatment associated adverse events for the period of one year. The secondary objective of efficacy will include evaluation at baseline and at months 3 and 12 of efficacy endpoints of C reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), anti-citrulline antibody, rheumatoid factor (RF), Quality of Life Questionnaire, 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28), European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria and immunological parameters."
