      "BriefSummary": "This study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Autologous Adipose-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell Gel combine with High tibial osteotomy therapy in the treatment of cartilage damage in the knee. Investigator believe that this method will enable patients to recover better knee function and more repair of knee cartilage.",
      "DetailedDescription": "The patients who will underwent high tibial osteotomy were randomly divided into the experimental group and the control group. Abdominal fat extraction before operation in experimental group to prepare Adipose-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell Gel, while the control group only underwent high tibial osteotomy. One month after operation, the experimental group was injected with Adipose-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell Gel into the joint cavity, and the control group was injected with sodium hyaluronate in the joint cavity. Two groups of patients were followed up."
