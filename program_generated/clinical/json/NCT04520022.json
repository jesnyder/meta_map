      "BriefSummary": "Previously, many studies have been conducted on mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow or subcutaneous fat, but interest in cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cell treatments has been increasing recently.\n\nIn the case of cord blood as a source, the isolation of mesenchymal stem cells is easier than bone marrow or fat tissue, and cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells have an advantage as a treatment because they have faster population doubling time.\n\nTo date, no clinical research on the treatment of patients using cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells has been reported in the literature, but there have already been registered at clinicaltrials.gov and currently being conducted overseas.\n\nIn this study, we will study the safety and effectiveness of RDEB patient treatment using cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells with these advantages.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Until now, all clinical trials for Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) have examined the potential of bone marrow-derived MSCs. However, umbilical cord blood (UCB) is another important source of stem cells, since its non-invasive collection procedure and rapid availability from cord blood banking. Human UCB-derived MSCs (hUCB-MSCs) exhibit high proliferation capacity and low immunogenicity. A few data support that UCB-MSCs may have significantly greater immunosuppressive potential than other sources of MSCs. A preclinical study has demonstrated that systemic infusions of human UCB-derived unrestricted somatic stem cells, a subpopulation of non-hematopoietic stromal stem cells, significantly extended the life span and reduced blistering of RDEB mice model. Given the promising results of the preclinical study, we conducted a first-in-human, phase 1/2a clinical trial of intravenous administrations of allogeneic hUCB-MSCs in patients with RDEB to determine the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy."
