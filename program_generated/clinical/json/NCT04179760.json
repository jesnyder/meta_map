      "DetailedDescription": "Phase I (Multicenter, Randomized, Open-label, Parallel arm Design) Twenty subjects with moderate to severe Atopic Dermatitis(AD) are planned to be enrolled from 6 sites in Korea and administered with SCM-AGH by intravenous (IV) infusion 3 times at two-week intervals and evaluated for safety during the safety evaluation period (12 weeks after first infusion).\n\nPhase II (Multicenter, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel arm) Phase II of the study is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm comparison study in adult subjects with moderate to severe AD. 72 subjects with moderate to severe AD are planned to be enrolled from 6 sites in Korea. Following up to a 4-week Screening period, subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatment arms: SCM-AGH or placebo in the ratio of 1:1."
