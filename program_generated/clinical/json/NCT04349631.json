      "BriefSummary": "Hope Biosciences is conducting a research study of an investigational product called autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (abbreviated as HB-adMSCs) to provide immune support against COVID-19. The study purpose is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of five IV infusions of HB-adMSCs in subjects with no signs of COVID-19.",
      "DetailedDescription": "This is a Phase II, Open Label, Single-Center, Clinical Trial to Assess Efficacy of HB-adMSCs to Provide Immune Support Against Coronavirus Disease. 75 patients will be enrolled. All patients have previously banked their own mesenchymal stem cells at Hope Biosciences. Eligible participants are either over 50 years of age, have preexisting conditions, or are at high exposure risk of contracting COVID-19. The primary endpoint of this study is to provide immune support against COVID-19, measured by the percentage of participants in each category of a 7-point ordinal scale and the presence or absence of adverse events and serious adverse events related to the study drug. In addition, participants will be monitored for overall clinical status by standard clinical laboratories and inflammatory markers. Participants will complete Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and depression module (PHQ-9) questionnaires."
