      "DetailedDescription": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder，which mainly shows up in the elderly. And there is as yet no effective drug treatment. Umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) derived from mesoderm owns strong proliferation ability and multiple differentiation potential. The investigators used UC-MSCs via intravenous infusion to treat PD. With different durations of follow-up, the investigators cleared therapeutic effect, the quality of life and prognostic implications of UC-MSCs on PD through the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), revised Hoehn-Yahr（H-Y） staging, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Hamilton depression scales 24 (HAMD 24), Hamilton Anxiety Scale 14 (HAMA 14) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI). In this research, the investigators seek new therapeutic approaches for PD, and provide clinical evidences for the clinical application of UC-MSCs in the future."
