      "BriefSummary": "Nonunion is a major complication of fractures.Per cutaneous bone marrow concentrate (BMC) application around fracture ends is being utilized with great success . Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs)are one of the major cell types found in BMC responsible for results Adipose tissue is an alternative source for MSCs. Besides abundant and readily accessible it also overcomes issue of morbidity with bone marrow aspiration.\n\nthis retrospective analysis to report the outcome in patients treated with fluoroscopic guided percutaneous injection of SVF at the site of fracture as an outpatient procedure between November 2012 to August 2018.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Nonunion is of major complication of fractures .The overall rate of non-union is still not clear but estimates from the published literature suggests a range between 5-10% of the total fractures.The gap in non-healing management has instigated the search for novel osteo-inductive substances. bone marrow concentrate is being utilized for many year with excellent results .Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs)are one of the major cell types of the Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate (BMAC)that self-renovates and differentiates into multiple cell types of mesodermal origin such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes.\n\nAdipose tissue is an alternative source for MSCs .besides abundant and readily accessible it also overcomes issue of morbidity with bone marrow aspiration.\n\nThis retrospective analysis was conducted to report the outcome in patients treated with fluoroscopic guided percutaneous injection of SVF at the site of fracture as an outpatient procedure between November 2012 to August 2018.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to report the feasibility of minimally invasive percutaneous injection with autologous SVF and study the osteo-inductive efficacy of Adipose derived stromal cells in SVF in the management of non-union."
