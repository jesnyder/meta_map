      "DetailedDescription": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) induce immune-modulatory and neurotrophic effects and were shown to have an acceptable safety profile for clinical applications. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MSC transplantation in active progressive MS and investigate possible neuroprotective effects.\n\nMethods: This single-center double-blind crossover trial enrolled 48 patients with progressive MS (expanded disability status scale (EDSS) range: 3.5-6.5, mean: 5.6+/-0.8). Patients were randomised into three groups and treated intrathecally (IT) or intravenously (IV) with autologous MSCs (1x106/Kg) or placebo. At 6-months, treatment groups were crossed over and patients re-treated with either MSC or placebo. During the 2-months run-in period and the 12-months after treatment, participants were followed using EDSS, 25-foot timed walking, 9-hole peg test, neurocognitive tests, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, optic coherence tomography (OCT), visual evoked potentials (VEP), and dynamic visual tests."
