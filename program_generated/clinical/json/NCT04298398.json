      "BriefSummary": "Background: There is some evidence demonstrating the effect of psychological interventions in improvements in health biological parameters. To best of our knowledge, no study had addressed the impact of any psychological intervention on extracellular vesicles. In addition, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Emotion Focused Therapy for Cancer Recovery (EFT-CR) in the group have never been explored regarding extracellular vesicles and the effectiveness of these was not compared yet.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo explore and compare the effect of MBCT and EFT-CR on biological parameters and psychological variables in distressed people who have had breast, prostate and colorectal cancer;\nIn addition, we will explore the acceptability through recruitment and retention rates of MBCT and EFT-CR in group and evaluate whether these interventions are appropriate for a larger clinical trial.\n\nMethods: The design of this study is a parallel randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomized into MBCT, EFT-CR or usual care. Outcome measures will be assessed before, at the end of the intervention (8 weeks) and follow-ups (24 and 52 weeks from the baseline moment).\n\nHypotheses: The researchers expected that both interventions will have an effect on extracellular vesicles and other study biomarkers as well as improvements in psychological outcomes, compared to treatment as usual (TAU) group. Regarding the comparative effectiveness, we did not have evidence to hypothesize which one of the interventions will be superior in both biological (extracellular vesicles) and psychological outcomes.\n\nContribution for practice: The results of this preliminary study would permit to know if there are benefits of these psychological interventions on changes in extracellular vesicles and on psychological outcomes related to health. In addition, this study will permit to determine the acceptability of conducting a larger randomized controlled trial."

On EFT-CR, therapist follows the client experience and guides the process, proposing therapeutic tasks when specific client behaviors occur. EFT-CR uses a set of emotion change principles which guide a process of emotional deepening process, from undifferentiated distress to secondary reactive emotions to primary maladaptive emotions to core pain and thence to primary adaptive emotions and emotional transformation (Elliott & Greenberg 2016).
