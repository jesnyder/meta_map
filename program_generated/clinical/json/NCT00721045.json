      "BriefSummary": "This is a dose-ranging clinical study to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of 3 different doses of immunoselected, culture expanded, nucleated, allogeneic MPCs in subjects who have cardiomyopathy of both ischemic and idiopathic etiology.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Heart failure subjects recruited will include those who have advanced heart failure NYHA (New York Heart Association) class II to IV and a depressed ejection fraction (EF < 40%). Baseline eligibility testing assessments will be completed within 28 days prior to cell delivery. Efficacy will be explored at 3, 6, and 12 months.\n\nThis will be a single-blinded, dose-escalation, cohort study in 60 subjects allocated sequentially to 1 of 3 cohorts A, B, or C. Forty-five subjects will be randomized to receive transendocardial delivery of MPC treatment, and 15 subjects will be randomized to receive standard-of-care treatment without MPC administration. The fifteen subjects randomized to receive standard of care without needle injection will serve as the study's control population and will undergo mock mapping and verbal injection scripts."
