      "BriefSummary": "Study Objects: Diabetes is an autoimmune disease which is mainly caused an immune reaction to beta cells in the pancreas. In this study, mesenchymal stem cells will be used for immune response modulation and improving regeneration. Study design and method: In a Triple blinded randomized placebo-controlled phase I/II clinical trial, 20 patients with newly diagnosed type-1 diabetes who would be visited in Children's Growth and Development Research Center of Tehran University of Medical Sciences and Royan Institute Cell Therapy Center, would be assessed through two groups including the case group and the placebo group. Participants: Patients of both sexes in a range of 8 to 40 years old who have been diagnosed to have type-1 diabetes in no more than 6 weeks, antibody against beta cells diagnosed in their blood, fasting c-peptide more than or equal to 0.3 ng/ml, and are not suffered from other acute or chronic diseases and cancers, would be studied. Interventions: Intravascular transplantation of autologous mesenchymal stem cells in the case group; placebo injection in the control group. Outcome variables: safety and efficacy.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Diabetes is an autoimmune disease which is mainly caused by an immune reaction to beta cells in the pancreas. Today, insulin injection is a routine treatment for diabetes. Although injected insulin maintains blood glucose, this method cannot result in physiologic reaction to blood glucose changes. Moreover, patients are encountered with diabetes complications like neuropathy, nephropathy, visual and cardiovascular problems, and hypoglycemic unawareness. Therefore, based on previous studies, a treatment option that leads to pancreatic beta cell restoration and inhibits the immune response to these cells could be a hopeful clinical choice. In this clinical trial, autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells will be used for immune response modulation and improving regeneration. Hence, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 20 patients with type-1 diabetes will be selected and after clarifying the procedure and fulfilling the agreement to participate in this trial, they will be sorted in two groups. Bone marrow is aspirated from patients bone and after isolation of Mesenchymal stem cells and characterization of these cells, patients in case group will be intravenously injected by 1 million autologous mesenchymal stem cells per kg of patient's body weight in each dose in week 0 and 3, whereas the control group receives a placebo. Then patients will be followed up for 1 year. During this time, different parameters would be evaluated in weeks 1, 2,4, and Months 2,3,6,9 and 12. Laboratory screenings will be done during this period to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this treatment."
