      "BriefSummary": "The purpose of the study is to assess long-term side effects from subjects who receive a Fate Therapeutics genetically modified NK cell product. Subjects who previously took part in a Fate Therapeutics study and received genetically changed NK cells will take part in this long-term follow-up study. Subjects will join this study once they complete the parent interventional study. No additional study drug will be given, but subjects can receive other therapies for their cancer while they are being followed for long term safety in this study.\n\nFor a period of 15 years starting from the last administration of Fate Therapeutics genetically modified NK cell product, subjects will be assessed for long-term safety and survival through questionnaires and blood tests.",
      "DetailedDescription": "This is a non-therapeutic, multi-center, long-term follow-up (LTFU) study of subjects who received a Fate Therapeutics NK cell product that has been modified by lentivirus-mediated genetically engineering. The period of follow-up is 15 years after the administration of the NK cell product.\n\nThe study involves up to 15 years post-infusion monitoring of subjects who have been exposed to lentivirus-mediated gene transfer in Fate Therapeutics clinical studies. Upon withdrawal or completion of the parent interventional study, the study site will contact the subject/healthcare provider/legal guardian annually."
