He suffered traumatic anterolisthesis at T10-11 with associated spinal cord transection and obliteration of the central canal. He and his family are requesting this Individual Patient Expanded Access IND with the purpose of possible restoration of nerve transmission and restoring sensation in his lower body using intravenous autologous adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells. This study will give 14 infusions of 200 million HB-adMSC's over a 52 week period."
