      "BriefSummary": "This protocol is part of an FDA Individual Patient Non-emergency Expanded Access Request submitted on behalf of a 38-year-old father and husband who on August 4, 2017 at about 4:30pm, slipped off a boat head-first while in the Florida Keys for a family wedding, and was immediately unable to move his legs. He was emergently transferred to Miami, FL for stabilization and treatment, where he was diagnosed with a C5 -C6 Grade 2 anterolisthesis of C5 on C6: 7mm, with flexion teardrop fracture of the anterior aspect of C6, as well as jumped facet on the right and perched facet on the left at C5-C6 with spinal canal stenosis with cord compression, as well as with aspiration and near drowning. He underwent ACDF (anterior cervical discectomy and fusion) of C5-C6 and reduction of jumped facets and was immediately started on a hypothermia protocol to reduce spinal cord edema. His hospital course was complicated by aspiration pneumonia. He discharged to Texas via air ambulance for physical rehabilitation on August 23, 2017 with a diagnosis of ASIA B (American Spinal Injury Association) C-5 SCI (spinal cord injury).",
      "DetailedDescription": "Once the eligibility is confirmed, approximately 1-3 weeks after the screening/baseline visit, the subject will receive the first infusion. Subsequent treatments will occur every other week in the subject's home, administered by a nurse.\n\nOn each of these visits, the subject will receive one autologous HB-adMSC infusion of 200 million (2 x 10^8 cells) total cells. Every infusion visit will include the following procedures:\n\nInterval H&P and concomitant medications update utilizing the secure VirTrial platform.\nQOL and Disability (SCIM self eval) surveys will be completed by the subject with the assistance of the primary caregiver.\nVital signs monitoring will be initiated (Heart Rate, BP, Resp., Temp., SpO2),\nA peripheral IV line will be inserted,\nA blood sample for clinical labs (CBC with Platelets, CMP, PT, PTT, TNFa, IL6, CRP) will be drawn monthly during the infusion period.\nA \"time out\" verification of patient/consent/procedure/cell product will be performed,\nThe HB-adMSC infusion will be given by through the peripheral IV, infused over 1 hour at a rate of 250ml/hr (83gtts/minute) by a registered nurse.\nAssessment for Infusion Related AE/SAEs\nThe subject will be monitored for a minimum of 2 hours\n\nIn-Person Visits The subject will return to the Clinical Trial Network CTN site for In-Person visits to occur at Screening, Baseline and Week twelve (12), twenty-six (26) and at Week fifty-two (52). Week 52 visit will serve as the End of Study visit. The end of study (EOS) visit will include an MRI of the c-spine as well as all of the study procedures for Follow-up Visits without Infusion. A written summary of the results of the treatment, including adverse events will be submitted to the FDA after completion of the last follow-up visit.\n\nVisits without infusion will include:\n\nInterval H&P and concomitant medications update.\nQOL and Disability (SCIM self eval) surveys will be completed by the subject with the assistance of the primary caregiver.\nVital signs monitoring will be initiated (Heart Rate, BP, Resp., Temp., SpO2),\nA Physical and Neuro Exam (Asia Impairment Scale) will be completed\nA blood sample for clinical labs (CBC with Platelets, CMP, PT, PTT, TNFa, IL6, CRP) will be drawn.\nVideo documentation of patient condition.\nAssessment for infusion related AEs/SAEs\nWeight"
