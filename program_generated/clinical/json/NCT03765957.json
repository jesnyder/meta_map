      "BriefSummary": "To evaluate the effect and safety of treatment of psoriasis by human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cel",
      "DetailedDescription": "Psoriasis is a chronic and recurrent inflammatory skin disease and its histological features are characterized by epidermal hyperplasia, increased angiogenesis and immune cell infiltration. Psoriasis prevalence is about 0.1%-3%, affecting approximately 125 million people worldwide. In China, there are about 10 million psoriasis patients.\n\nHuman umbilical cord-derived MSC (huc-MSC) has many advantages for the treatment of immune disease. Because it was demonstrated that huc-MSCs are effective in modulating immune cells and treating diseases and it has low immunogenicity. Furthermore, huc-MSCs do not raise ethical issue for clinical applications.\n\nSome experimental results and cases has showed that mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) can prevent or treat psoriasis. This clinical study is conducted to provide more data to evaluate the effect and safety of treatment of psoriasis by human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell."
