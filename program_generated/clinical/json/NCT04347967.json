      "BriefSummary": "The clinical study with UMC119-06 is designed to investigate the safety in patients with moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (\"ARDS\"). This will be a dose escalation, open-label, single-center study in adult with ARDS. UMC119-06 is ex vivo cultured human umbilical cord derived mensenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) product which is intended for treatment of ARDS.",
      "DetailedDescription": "ARDS, a noncardiogenic respiratory disease, is characterized by progressive hypoxemia and respiratory distress, associated with explosive acute inflammation and alveolar edema. ARDS occurs in all age group of patients, where mortality rates increase in advancing age.\n\nIn animal studies of ARDS, mensenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can attenuate lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced lung injury and pulmonary permeability edema through modulating the inflammatory. These findings show that MSCs may improve the clinical outcomes and prognosis of ARDS patient. Meridigen is developing UMC119-06, human umbilical cord-derived MSCs, for the treatment of ARDS. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of UMC119-06 in patients with ARDS."
