      "DetailedDescription": "Allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will be delivered intravenously at one of four doses: 1 x 10 6 MSC/kg, 3 x 10 6 MSC/kg, 6 x 10 6 MSC/kg, or 10 x 10 6 MSC/kg of body weight to a population of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD). The infusion will be at 1 week after the baseline visit, following two screening visits. Patients will be followed until 52 weeks after the infusion visit. The safety of the therapy, as well as the impact of the therapy on the rate of Parkinson's disease (PD) progression, will be assessed."
