      "BriefSummary": "Many preclinical studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of intermittent fasting (IF) in a wide range of neurological and cardiovascular diseases. This pilot study aims to investigate the safety and compliance as well as efficacy of one specific IF intervention called time-restricted feeding (TRF; 16 hours fasting daily) in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).",
      "DetailedDescription": "Specific Aims This project is to conduct a pilot, phase II randomized clinical trial which aims to investigate the safety and compliance as well as efficacy of one specific IF intervention called time-restricted feeding (TRF; 16 hours fasting daily) in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) The primary endpoint is the safety and compliance of 4 weeks of TRF in AIS patients.\n\nThe secondary endpoints are the efficacy of 4 weeks of TRF compared to normal eating (NE) on plasma and imaging biomarkers and functional outcome at 3 months post-stroke.\n\nThis study will determine whether compared to NE control:\n\nTRF (16 hours fasting daily) is safe and well-tolerated in patients with AIS.\nTRF improves functional outcome compared to NE in AIS patients. (3) TRF decreases plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines including metallopeptidase (MMP)-9, interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) in plasma compared to baseline and NE in AIS patients.\n\n(4) TRF improves diffusion tensor imaging on MRI at 3 months post stroke compared to baseline and NE in AIS patients.\n\n(5) TRF changes plasma exosome components, metabolomics and lipidomics compared to baseline and NE in AIS patients."
