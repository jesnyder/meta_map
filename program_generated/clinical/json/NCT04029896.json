      "BriefSummary": "This is an Individual Patient Expanded Access Protocol of Autologous HB-adMSCs for the Treatment of Cerebral Palsy (CP) with the primary goal of treating 1 individual with CP who has exhausted all treatment options, his condition has not improved, his quality of life is severely affected by the condition and he has previously banked his mesenchymal stem cells. There are no FDA approved, fully restorative treatments for CP. The subject will receive 8 autologous HB-adMSC infusions of 50 million (50 x 10^6 cells) total cells. A protocol amendment to administer additional HB-adMSC infusions may be submitted for IRB/FDA for approval depending on the patient's response, AE/SAEs, and cell expansion characteristics.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Once the eligibility is confirmed, approximately 1-3 weeks after the screening/baseline visit, the subject will return for the first infusions. Subsequent treatments will occur every other week.\n\nOn each of these visits, the subject will receive one autologous HB-adMSC infusion of 50 million (50 x 10^6 cells) total cells. Every infusion visit will include the following procedures:\n\nInterval H&P update,\nWeight\nVital signs monitoring (Heart Rate, BP, Resp., Temp., SpO2),\nA urine and blood sample for clinical labs (CBC with diff., CMP, and Coagulation Panel, Serum Leptin),\nA verification of patient/LAR consent will be verbally performed,\nThe HB-adMSC infusion will be given via IV over a 1 hour period.\nThe subject will then be monitored for a minimum of 4hr.\n24-hour telephone assessment for adverse events\nVideo Documentation\n\nFollow Up Visits Week 4, 8, 12 and 16 (Safety Assessments)\n\nThe patient will be assessed for adverse events 24 hours after each infusion with a follow up phone call. 4 weeks after the first infusion have occurred, the subject will return to the clinical site for an onsite safety assessment, which will be repeated at week 8, 12, and 16. Each one of these on-site safety assessments will include:\n\nReview and update medical history,\nUpdate concomitant medications list\nVideo documentation\nWeight\nVital signs (Heart Rate, BP, Respirations, Temp., SpO2),\nPhysical exam,\nA urine and blood sample for clinical labs (CBC with diff., CMP, and Coagulation Panel and serum leptin)\nSARAH assessment on Weeks 4, 12 and 16.\nAdverse event monitoring Follow Up Visit Week 26 (Safety Assessments)\n\n1. Review and update medical history, 2. Update concomitant medications list 3. Weight 4. Vital signs (Heart Rate, BP, Respirations, Temp., SpO2), 5. Physical exam, 6. A urine and blood sample for clinical labs (CBC with diff., CMP, and Coagulation Panel and serum leptin), 7. Brain MRI 8. The SARAH (motor-functional evaluation scale for children and adolescents with cerebral palsy) 9. Adverse event monitoring 10. Video documentation\n\nFollow Up Visit Week 52 (Safety Assessments-End of Study)\n\nReview and update medical history,\nUpdate concomitant medications list\nWeight\nVital signs (Heart Rate, BP, Respirations, Temp., SpO2),\nPhysical exam,\nA urine and blood sample for clinical labs (CBC with diff., CMP, and Coagulation Panel and serum leptin),\nChest X ray (PA Single view)\nThe SARAH (motor-functional evaluation scale for children and adolescents with cerebral palsy)\nAdverse event monitoring\nVideo documentation"
