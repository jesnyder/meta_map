      "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of combined Bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) and Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) action after a single hip intraarticular injection to young symptomatic patients with primary radiologic stage of hip OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade I or II) compared to a control local anesthetic with cortisone injection group of patients. The hypothesis is that the patients with hip OA will benefit more and for longer from OA symptoms in the BMAC and PRP group rather than in the group of local anaesthetic and cortisone. Furthermore, this study could be valuable in determining the safety and effectiveness of the BMAC and PRP combined injection for early low grade hip OA in young active patients who are neither good candidates for total hip replacement nor preservative hip surgery.",
      "DetailedDescription": "The protocol will be applied to a blinded randomized controlled study. Patients who fit the inclusion criteria and have consented to the trial, will be randomized to receive a single injection of BMAC with PRP or local anesthetic with cortisone.\n\nPre-Injection Procedures:\n\nPatients will receive a clinical evaluation where they will complete the HHS, the WOMAC score, the VR-12 form, VAS score, and the two functional assessment tests to assess pain and function prior to the injection. The two functional assessments will be performed by the blinded researcher. Following the evaluation, the patients will receive an intra-articular hip injection.\n\nInjection Procedures:\n\nControl group: In the second group of patients, an intraarticular injection of 1cm3 with 80mg of methylprednisolone combined with 3cm3 of 0.25% bupivacaine will be performed in the same manner with the first group.\n\nExperimental group: In the first group, patients will be placed on an office procedure under local anesthesia. The investigators will harvest 60 cm3 of bone marrow from posterior iliac crest and centrifuged obtaining approximately 3 cm3 of autologous bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells concentrate. At the same time, 60cm3 of peripheral blood will be taken and centrifugated once, to obtain approximately 3 cm3 of PRP. After activation of platelet rich plasma cells they will be mixed in one syringe with the concentrated BMaC and both will be injected in the hip joint under ultrasound. In all cases four samples of 0.2cm3 will be collected, one with patient's whole blood, one with the PRPs final mixture, one with whole bone marrow aspirate, and one with the BMaCs final mixture, and will be sent to the NSHA Hematology Laboratory for cell quantification. The leukocyte counts and differential (neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils and basophils) as well as thrombocyte counts in all samples will be determined using Automated Hematology Analyzer (Sysmex). Percentages of mature and immature leukocytes in the bone marrow aspirate and BMaC samples will be determined by standard morphologic examination using slides prepared with the Wright's stain. CD34+ stem cell enumeration in the bone marrow aspirate sample and BMaC will be performed by flow cytometry (Canto II Analyser).The concentration factor of PRP will be calculated from the quotient of the thrombocyte count in whole blood and in PRP. Additionally, IGF-I, VEGF, TGF-b, bFGF, HGF and PDGF will be quantified in serum or plasma and in PRP using commercially available ELISA kits (QuantikineH, ELISA KITS, R&D Systems, USA).\n\nPost-Injection Procedures:\n\nClinic visits will occur at 6, 12, 24, and 48 weeks post-injection to perform clinical evaluations with outcome measures of the patients. All collected data will be statistically analyzed to check the effect of BMAC and PRP intraarticular hip injections in young patients with early OA. The investigators will also document the activity level of all participants (type of sport or activity participated in and the intensity and volume of participation) and correlate it with the outcomes."
