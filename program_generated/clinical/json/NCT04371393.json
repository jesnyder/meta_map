      "BriefSummary": "The mortality rate in SARS-CoV-2-related severe ARDS is high despite treatment with antivirals, glucocorticoids, immunoglobulins, and ventilation. Preclinical and clinical evidence indicate that MSCs migrate to the lung and respond to the pro-inflammatory lung environment by releasing anti-inflammatory factors reducing the proliferation of pro-inflammatory cytokines while modulating regulatory T cells and macrophages to promote resolution of inflammation. Therefore, MSCs may have the potential to increase survival in management of COVID-19 induced ARDS.\n\nThe primary objective of this phase 3 trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition of the mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) remestemcel-L plus standard of care compared to placebo plus standard of care in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to SARS-CoV-2. The secondary objective is to assess the impact of MSCs on inflammatory biomarkers.",
      "DetailedDescription": "This will be a randomized (1:1 ratio), double blind, parallel design, placebo controlled trial. Randomization will be stratified by clinical center and by moderate versus severe ARDS. The study is designed to have three interim analyses for stopping accrual early for efficacy and futility when 30%, 45% and 60% of the 300 patients have reached the primary endpoint using Bayesian predictive probabilities.\n\nPatients will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation to intravenous infusion of MSCs (remestemcel-L) plus standard of care versus placebo plus standard of care for the treatment of COVID-19 related ARDS:\n\nGroup 1: 2x10^6 MSC/kg of body weight plus standard of care, administered twice during the first week, with the second infusion at 4 days following the first infusion (± 1 day)\nGroup 2: Placebo (Plasma-Lyte) plus standard of care, administered twice during the first week, with the second infusion at 4 days following the first infusion (± 1 day) (control)\n\nMSCs and placebo will initially be administered intravenously in the dose defined above at randomization. The rate of infusion may be tailored to the patient's respiratory status and fluid status, but the duration of infusion should not exceed 60 minutes.\n\nPatients will be followed for 90 days post randomization, with assessment of pulmonary symptoms at 6 and 12 months."

These opacities are not fully explained by pleural effusions, lobar collapse, lung collapse, or pulmonary nodules.\nRespiratory failure not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload.\nModerate to severe impairment of oxygenation must be present, as defined by the ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2). The severity of the hypoxemia defines the severity of the ARDS:\nModerate ARDS: PaO2/FiO2 >100 mmHg and ≤200 mmHg, on ventilator settings that include PEEP ≥5 cm H2O OR\nSevere ARDS: PaO2/FiO2 ≤100 mmHg on ventilator settings that include PEEP ≥5 cm H2O\nHigh sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) or CRP serum level >4.0 mg/dL\nAcute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE IV) score >5\nCreatinine clearance of ≥ 30 mL/minute OR a creatinine clearance of 20-29 mL/minute with urine output of ≥0.3 mLs/kg/hour over the last 8 hours or ≥500 mLs over the last 24 hours\nThe patient or his/her legally authorized representative (LAR) is able to provide informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nCurrently receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV)\nFemales who are pregnant or lactating\nPatients with established positive bacterial blood cultures prior to enrollment or suspicion of superimposed bacterial pneumonia\nPatients with BMI >55\nPatients with untreated HIV infection\nPatients with malignancy who are within 12 months of active treatment with any chemotherapy, radiation or immunotherapy.\nPatients who have been intubated for more than 72 hours in total at the time of randomization\nCreatinine clearance less than 20 mL/minute or receiving renal replacement therapy\nLFTs (isolated ALT or AST) > 8x upper limit of normal or > 5x upper limit of normal in the setting of other liver function abnormalities (i.e., total bilirubin ≥ 2x upper limit of normal)\nKnown hypersensitivity to DMSO or to porcine or bovine proteins\nHistory of prior respiratory disease with requirement for supplemental oxygen\nAny end-stage organ disease which in the opinion of the investigator may possibly affect the safety of remestemcel-L treatment\nReceiving an investigational cellular therapy agent",
