      "DetailedDescription": "MitoCell is an autologous stem cell product that cultures with the company's unique patented medium. The mechanism of action of MitoCell is to improve the brain microenvironment in neurodegenerative disease. MitoCell which like mesenchymal stem cells modulate the immune response, and secrete more BDNF and SDF-1 neurotrophic factors than regular stem cell products.Therefore, MitoCell can protect and repair damaged dopamine neurons (DA) and stimulate DA regeneration.This project is a phase I open-label dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of autologous MitoCell intracranial transplantation in subjects with idiopathic Parkinson's disease which rating from stage 3 ~ 4 of modified Hoehn & Yahr staging."
