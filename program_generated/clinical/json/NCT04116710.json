      "DetailedDescription": "This is an open-label, non-controlled, first-in-human Phase I study of HS-130 and HS-110 in patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to, or ineligible for, Standard of Care.\n\nSeven dose levels will be explored in escalating doses. For each dose level, patients will receive combination HS-130 and HS-110 via intradermal injections once every 14 days. The Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) window of observation will include the first 28 days of treatment. In the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, patients will continue to receive combination treatment every two weeks until disease progression, death, patient's withdrawal of consent, Investigator decision to discontinue treatment, or intolerable toxicity, whichever occurs first."

Permanent but stable and manageable immune related adverse events (irAE) from prior therapies are permissible, if prednisone equivalent corticosteroid use does not exceed 10 mg/day.\nAny other condition requiring concurrent systemic immunosuppressive therapy (other than allowable exceptions which do not exceed 10mg/day of prednisone/corticosteroid use).\nMajor surgery (requiring general anesthesia or inpatient hospitalization) within four weeks before first IMP administration.\nAny ongoing anticancer therapy including; small molecules, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies or any other experimental drug. Prior therapy must be stopped within four weeks before first infusion in the study, or 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the investigational product (whichever is shortest). Adjuvant anti-hormonal treatment(s) for previously treated breast cancer or prostate cancer are allowed. Bisphosphonates are allowed, Denosumab and other RANK ligand inhibitors are prohibited.\nKnown current malignancy other than inclusion diagnosis. Prior curable cancer with complete remission for >2 years is allowed.\nAny other ongoing significant, uncontrolled medical condition as per Investigator discretion.\nReceived a live vaccine within 30 days prior to first dose of study drug.\n\nClinically significant active viral, bacterial or fungal infection requiring:\n\nIntravenous treatment with antimicrobial therapy completed less than two weeks prior to first dose, or\nOral treatment with antimicrobial therapy completed less than one week prior to first dose.\n\nProphylactic treatment with antibiotics (e.g. for dental extractions) is allowed.\n\nKnown positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C (except in cases of immunity after cured infection). Testing not required.\nSubstance abuse, medical, psychological or social conditions that may interfere with the patient's participation in the trial or evaluation of the trial result in the opinion of the Investigator.\nWomen who are pregnant or breast feeding.",
