      "BriefSummary": "Children with neurodevelopmental disabilities (ND) represent an heterogeneous population characterized by a wide range of clinical diagnoses (e.g., cerebral palsy, sensory impairment, psychomotor retardation), which are associated with various deficits that emerge early in the child's life. Although it has been broadly demonstrated that children with ND exhibit several differences in social-emotional skills and emotional-behavioral regulation, the underlying mechanisms that are associated with more or less impaired developmental trajectories remain still partially unexplored. While several studies have investigated the role of biological and environmental factors in the emotional behavioral regulation of typically developing children or children with risk conditions other than ND (e.g., children who are victims of maltreatment), little research has jointly explored the role of methylation, polymorphisms, and environmental experience in the emotional-behavioral regulation of children with ND during the first years of life. The aim of this project is to investigate biological (DNA methylation, polymorphic variants, and proteomics) and environmental (e.g., painful and/or invasive nursing procedures, proximity, and physical contact) factors that might be associated with the emotional behavioral regulation of children with ND.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Background: Children with neurodevelopmental disabilities (ND) are an heterogeneous population characterized by a wide variety of clinical diagnoses, which are associated with different deficits that emerge during infancy and childhood. Although diagnostic framing may vary, several studies observed that children with ND share reduced social-relational skills, characterized by lower interactive and dyadic attention skills and decreased use of interpersonal communication cues. Although it has been broadly demonstrated that children with ND exhibit several differences in social-emotional skills and emotional behavioral regulation, the underlying mechanisms that are associated with more or less impaired trajectories remain partially unexplored.\n\nPrimary aim: to explore in a sample of children with ND aged 3 to 24 months the contribution of 1) methylation of candidate genes (e.g., OXTR, SLC6A4, BDNF, and DRD4), 2) polymorphisms in emotional-behavioral regulation, and 3) environmental experience (i.e., adverse experiences and quality of parental behavior) in emotional-behavioral regulation.\n\nSecondary aim: 1) to explore a possible association between proteomics and emotional-behavioral regulation in a sample of children with ND aged between 3 and 24 months; 2) to identify functional and structural patterns of candidate genes associated with emotional behavioral regulation by applying a computational approach. Modules of genes potentially associated with social-emotional development in networks of interaction and spatio-temporal co-expression in the encephalon will also be identified.\n\nPlanned Activities:\n\nMethods:the project involves a clinical group of children with ND and their mothers and a control group of typically developing children and their mothers. Because of the nature of the groups, the study is a quasi-experimental research design.\n\nThe study involves the following procedures:\n\ncollection of biological material: saliva collection using non-invasive modalities and the Oragene OG575 kit (Genotek DNA) and urine collection using non-invasive modalities.\nadministration of questionnaires and diary of proximity: the mother (both for the clinical group and for the control group) will be asked to fill out some questionnaires relating to their mood, habitual behavior and development of the child. It will also be evaluated how much and in what way the mother spends in physical contact (e.g. time spent caressing the baby; time spent holding the baby; time spent when the baby is attached to the mother's breast). This data will be derived through the use of a repurposed version of Raiskila et al.'s \"closeness diary\" implemented in an electronic format, in the form of an APP (APP: inContatto);\nvideotaping the Parent-Child Interaction in a semi-structured context in 5 different phases in accordance with the Still Face paradigm (Tronick et al., 1978): Play, Still#1, Reunion#1, Still#2, Reunion#2.\n\nInteractions will be videotaped for subsequent behavioral coding using various coding tools. The child's emotional-behavioral regulation will be coded using the coding systems: a) Infant and Caregiver Engagement Phase, b) Infant Regulatory Scoring System and Maternal Regulatory Scoring System by Tronik. In addition, infant and maternal behavior will be coded using the Global Rating Scale coding system by Murray and maternal touch behavior using the Maternal Touch Coding System by Provenzi."

Individual processed sequences (PE reads) will be independently aligned to reference sequences using a parallel Smith-Waterman algorithm.

A second tryptic digestion is performed with an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w) for 4h.
