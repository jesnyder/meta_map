      "BriefSummary": "Investigation into the use of teriparatide in the treatment of stress fractures.\n\nPrimary outcome is healing on MRI, secondary outcomes are pain, time spent in rehabilitation and future stress fractures. This study will help the investigators understand how to treat stress fractures in the future.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Teriparatide is a drug that is designed to have a similar effect on the body as parathyroid hormone. Parathyroid hormone is made naturally in the body and is released in response to low calcium levels. It helps to maintain bone health and repair bone damage. Parathyroid hormone and medicines like teriparatide can strengthen bones and are often given to people with osteoporosis (a condition that weakens bones, making them more likely to break) to reduce the risk of fractures. Recent studies have also shown benefits in people with stress fracture injuries, a form of bone damage sometimes caused by repetitive exercise. The investigators want to know if teriparatide is also beneficial to healthy, younger people who have a stress fracture injury."
