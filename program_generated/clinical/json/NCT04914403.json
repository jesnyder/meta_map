      "BriefSummary": "The clinical study with UMC119-06-05 is designed to investigate the safety in patients with frailty syndrome. This will be a dose escalation, open label, single-center study in adult with frailty syndrome. UMC119-06-05 is ex vivo cultured human umbilical cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells product which is intended for treatment of frailty syndrome.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Frailty syndrome is the most problematic expression of population ageing and profound implications for the planning and delivery of health and social care when population ageing is accelerating rapidly worldwide, from 461 million people older than 65 years in 2004 to an estimated 2 billion people by 2050 . Frailty syndrome characterized by a progressive decline in health and clinical symptoms of exhaustion, weight loss, a feeling of slowing down, and a decrease in functional capacity. Frailty is a common clinical syndrome in older adults that carries an increased risk for poor health outcomes including falls, incident disability, hospitalization, and mortality. Health study as meeting three out of five phenotypic criteria: low grip strength, self-reported exhaustion, slowed walking speed, low physical activity, and unintentional weight loss. Frailty is a disorder of several inter-related physiological systems, including genetic and environmental factors in combination with epigenetic mechanisms, which regulate the differential expression of genes in cells and could be especially important in ageing. Current interventions focus on interdisciplinary approaches which include nutritional supplementation, physical exercise, and cognitive intervention. Clinical studies of these preventative approaches have shown inconsistent and modest benefits, further highlighting the unmet clinical need. Therefore, development of new therapeutic modalities to improve the clinical outcomes and prognosis of frailty syndrome in adult patients is of urgent need. A variety of pharmacologic and biologic therapies are currently being tested to treat aging. Among the more innovative, experimental therapies, Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) are represents an attractive option that addresses the pathophysiology of the syndrome."
