      "BriefSummary": "Background:\n\nAge-related macular degeneration is a common eye disease in people over 50. The \"dry\" form of the disease can worsen into geographic atrophy, causing blind spots. Researchers want to learn if replacing older eye cells with younger ones can help treat this disease.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test the safety of putting cells inside the eye as a possible future treatment for dry age-related macular degeneration.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople ages 55 and older who have geographic atrophy with loss of vision. People who have had \"wet\" macular degeneration in either eye are NOT eligible.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\nMedical history\nPhysical exam\nBlood and urine tests\nEye exam\nEye photos\nFluorescein angiography. An intravenous (IV) line is placed in an arm vein. A dye is injected. A camera takes pictures of the dye as it flows through the eyes' blood vessels.\nElectroretinography. An electrode is taped to participants' forehead. They sit in the dark. After 30 minutes, numbing eye drops and contact lenses are placed in their eyes. They watch flashing lights.\nTuberculosis test\nChest X-ray\nElectrocardiography. Sticky pads are placed on participants' chest to record the heart's electrical activity.\n\nParticipants will have at least 14 study visits over 5 and a half years. They will repeat screening tests.\n\nParticipants will have retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) transplantation surgery in one eye. For this, cells from participants' blood are turned into RPE cells. These cells are placed in their eye through a cut in their retina. They will get dilating eye drops, an IV line, and anesthesia that may make them sleep. A gas bubble will be put in their eye to help it heal.\n\nParticipants will be contacted yearly for up to 15 years.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss among the elderly. There is no treatment for geographic atrophy (GA), the advanced stage of dry AMD, in which cells of the neurosensory retina and associated retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) gradually degenerate and die. Advances in stem cell biology allowing differentiation of pluripotent cells into RPE in vitro make feasible a cell-based strategy for potential treatment of AMD, and recent methods for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation offer promise of individualized autologous] therapy. Such an approach involves generation of iPSC from somatic cells taken from a patient with GA, differentiation of iPSC into RPE grown as a monolayer on a thin scaffold in vitro, and transplantation of the RPE/scaffold construct into a small region in the subretinal space of the same patient, with a goal of rescuing the overlying neurosensory retina from further degeneration.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of subretinal transplantation of iPSC-derived RPE, grown as a monolayer on a biodegradable poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) scaffold, as a potential autologous cell-based therapy for GA associated with AMD.\n\nStudy Population: Five participants will undergo RPE transplantation in one eye. Eligible eyes will have GA, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between 20/100 and 20/500, and a fellow eye that has same or better BCVA. If the National Eye Institute (NEI) Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) gives clearance to proceed based on review of data from the first cohort, a second cohort of up to seven additional participants with GA, BCVA between 20/80 and 20/500 in the eye being considered for RPE transplantation, and same or better visual acuity in the other eye may undergo the procedure to gather additional safety and potential efficacy data useful for planning future studies. Up to 20 participants may be enrolled to allow for screening failures or for participants withdrawing from the study prior to RPE transplantation.\n\nDesign: In this phase I/IIa, prospective, single-arm, single-center clinical trial, participants will undergo subretinal transplantation of autologous iPSC-derived RPE in one eye and will be followed for five years after surgery.\n\nOutcome Measures: The primary outcome measure is the safety of RPE/PLGA transplantation, as determined by assessment of visual acuity change and summary of adverse events at 12 months after RPE/PLGA transplantation. Secondary outcome measures include visual acuity change and adverse event reporting at 24 and 60 months, and changes in the following at 12, 24 and 60 months as compared with baseline, assessed in the transplanted region, and compared where applicable with other areas in the macula, and/or with corresponding regions in the fellow eye: retinal sensitivity and fixation parameters assessed by microperimetry; multifocal electroretinography (ERG) responses; macular structure on cross-sectional and en face imaging by optical coherence tomography (OCT); macular features on color, single-wavelength reflectance, and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) photography; and fluorescein angiography (FA). Some participants may undergo imaging of photoreceptor/RPE features using adaptive-optics-assisted macular imaging under a separate protocol (e.g., 15-EI-0020)."

Acceptable methods of contraception include:\n\nHormonal contraception (i.e., birth control pills, injected hormones, dermal patch or vaginal ring),\nIntrauterine device,\nBarrier methods (diaphragm, condom) with spermicide, or\nSurgical sterilization (tubal ligation).\nParticipant must be medically able to comply with the study treatment (including ability to safely receive anesthesia for surgery), study testing and procedures, and follow-up visits.\n\nStudy Eye Inclusion Criteria:\n\nThe study eye must have one or more regions of geographic atrophy with total area of 1 disc area or more. A region of geographic atrophy is defined as an area of uniform hypofluorescence on fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging, with greatest linear dimension at least 500 micrometer , with a border within 500 micrometer of the foveal center, not compatible with pigmentary changes, drusen, RPE detachment, drusenoid RPE detachment, hemorrhage, or other lesion. (Note: If macular geographic atrophy is contiguous with peripapillary atrophy, complicating calculation of total area, only atrophy temporal to a vertical line placed a half disc diameter temporal to the temporal border of the disc will be included in the total area of geographic atrophy calculated for eligibility purposes.)\nFor participants in the first cohort, the study eye must have an ETDRS best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) letter score of less than or equal to 53 and greater than or equal to 14 (i.e., Snellen equivalent between 20/100 and 20/500), and the fellow eye must have a letter score no more than five letters worse than the study eye using Electronic Visual Acuity (EVA) testing. (Note: Letter scores within five or fewer letters of each other are accordingly considered equal for eligibility determination, and other factors may be used to select the study eye if both are eligible by BCVA.)\nFor participants in the second cohort, the study eye must have an ETDRS best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) letter score of less than or equal to 58 and greater than or equal to 14 (i.e., Snellen equivalent between 20/80 and 20/500), and the fellow eye must have a letter score no more than five letters worse than the study eye using Electronic Visual Acuity (EVA) testing.

(Note: History of self-limited acute glaucoma in a study or fellow eye, if not secondary to steroid response, and if now resolved and not expected to recur (e.g., history of elevated intraocular pressure from retained visco-elastic after cataract surgery), is not exclusionary. History of glaucoma or ocular hypertension in the fellow eye, if not felt to significantly impact risk of glaucoma in the study eye, is not exclusionary.)\nThe study eye must not have a condition materially increasing the risks of surgery or potentially affecting visual function over the next two years in the judgment of the investigator, such as chronic uveitis, diabetic retinopathy, keratitis, scleritis, optic neuropathy, untreated retinal detachment, macular edema from prior vein occlusion or other cause, proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), vitreous hemorrhage, pathologic myopia, etc. A history of such conditions is not exclusionary, if judged to not materially increase risks of surgery or to potentially affect vision in the next two years in the opinion of the investigator.",
