      "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of intracoronary human umbilical Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cell (WJ-MSC) transfer in patients with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction.",
      "DetailedDescription": "It has been demonstrated that MSCs have the potential to differentiate into cardiomyocytes both in vitro and in vivo. Several clinical trials have been performed using autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs, but the results of these trials have been unsatisfactory because of a low number of MSCs in older patients and in those with coronary heart disease. WJ-MSCs from the human umbilical cord matrix which are of epiblastic origin and contain both human embryonic stem cell (hESC) and human mesenchymal stem cell markers appear to have a number of important advantages: they do not raise ethical issues, are widely multipotent, are not tumorigenic, and are not immunogenetic. Because of a short population doubling time they can be rapidly scaled up in large numbers. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, randomly assigning 160 patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to receive an intracoronary infusion of WJ-MSCs or placebo medium into the infarct artery 4-7 days after successful reperfusion therapy."
