      "BriefSummary": "This phase II trial studies the effect of P140K MGMT hematopoietic stem cells, O6-benzylguanine, temozolomide, and carmustine in treating participants with supratentorial glioblastoma or gliosarcoma who have recently had surgery to remove most or all of the brain tumor (resected). Chemotherapy drugs, such as 6-benzylguanine, temozolomide, and carmustine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing. Placing P140K MGMT, a gene that has been created in the laboratory into bone marrow making the bone more resistant to chemotherapy, allowing intra-patient dose escalation which kills more tumor cells while allowing bone marrow to survive."

Patients with primarily infratentorial disease, or with multifocal,or leptomeningeal dissemination of disease will be excluded. In general, patients will not have > 1 cm residual measurable or evaluable disease after surgical tumor resection.\nPatient must have unmethylated MGMT\nAbsence Of IDH1 or IDH2mutation on tumor tissue by a CLIA-approved immunohistochemistry or DNA sequencing test on local testing\nPatients aged 18-70years. (Patients >70 years will be excluded due to difficulties in mobilizationand collection of adequate numbers of peripheral progenitors.)\nECOG performance status 0-1or Karnofsky ≥ 70.\nNo myelosuppressive chemotherapy or hematopoietic cell transplantation prior to the diagnosis of GBM and no prior chemotherapy (including Gliadel BCNU wafers) for GBM\nLife expectancy of at least 12 weeks.\nNo plan for hypofractionated radiation therapy\nAdequate hematologic (absolute neutrophil count (ANC)≥ 1000/mm3, platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3, Hgb ≥ 9.5, hepatic (Bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl, AST and ALT less than or equal to 3 times institutional upper limit of normal, prothrombin time <1.2 times normal), and renal (serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl or Creatinine Clearance ≥ 60mL/min/1.73 m2for subjects with serum creatinine levels above institutional normal). These tests will be repeated within 2 weeks of treatment with BG and TMZ, and must meet the same criteria. -Post-operative steroids are i) tapered to ≤ 8mg dexamethasone/day(or equivalent)and ii) patient has been on a stable or decreasing steroid dose for the 7 days prior to enrollment\nPatients of child-bearing potential must agree to using single barrier contraception.\nMust be willing and able to understand provide informed consent.\nPatient must have all sutures removed prior to registration\nPatient must be considered to be clinically stable.\nNo evidence of active infection.\nAvailability of 10unstained slides or FFPE sample of tumor for molecular or histopathological studies.\nNegative HIV screening\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nAny known medical or hereditary condition associated with immunosuppression;orothermedical illness which may jeopardize patient safety.\nKnown history of HIV seropositivity. This exclusion is included for two reasons. First, there is evidence of decreased marrow reserve in HIV+ patients and antiviral treatment is associated with myelosuppression. Thus, drug treatment designed to be myelosuppressive may bemore toxic in this patient population. Second, extensive laboratory culturing of the bone marrow and peripheral blood progenitor cells is required. No preclinical samples which are HIV+ have been evaluated with the gene transfer modality proposed and thus the feasibility and safety of gene transfer and selection in HIV+ samples cannot yet be advocated. Such studies are planned so as to not preclude HIV+ patients in later studies.\nPregnant or lactating women. There is data to indicate that BCNU and TMZ is teratogenic and carcinogenic. Thus, its use in pregnant women would confer unnecessary risk to the fetus.\nPatients with symptomatic pulmonary disease and other severe co-morbid respiratory conditions, including patients with active pulmonary infection and/or pulse oximetry < 90% and a corrected DLCO < 50% of predicted. However, subjects with a corrected DLCO in the range of 50-70% should have Pulmonologyclearance prior to intervention.\nPatients with known diagnosis heart failure or cardiac insufficiency and an LVEF of < 40%. History of acute coronary event including MI within 6 months prior to study enrollment.\nKnown history of cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, tachyarrhythmiaor bradycardia.Inability to undergo repeated MRI evaluation; or allergy or intolerance of Gadolinium-containing contrast agent.\nActive illicit drug use or diagnosis of alcoholism.\nPrior diagnosis of any malignant disease with the exception of non-melanomatous skin cancer, or carcinoma in situof the cervix, bladder, prostate, or breast, unless patient has been disease-free/in remission for ≥2 years prior to date of study enrollment.\nMental incapacity or psychiatric illness preventing informed consent.\nHistory of Hepatitis B or C or Hepatitis grade ≥3 are excluded due to the potential for additional hepatotixicity",
