Patients of case group will receive intra-articular injection of autologous BMSCs suspended in 3 ml autologous PRP for 3 times, patients of control group will receive intra-articular injection of 3 ml of autologous PRP for 3 times. The investigators designed this clinical study to evaluate therapeutic effects of BM-MSCs in patients with severe knee osteoarthritis."
