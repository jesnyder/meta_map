      "BriefSummary": "STUDY OBJECTIVES:\n\nPrimary Objective: Assessment of treatment safety based on incidence of any treatment emergent/treatment associated adverse events prior to discharge and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post treatment.\n\nSecondary objective: Assessment of efficacy at baseline, prior to discharge, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after treatment based on the following: EDSS and 29-item Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), MS Functional Composite (MSFC) consisting of (1) Timed 25-Foot Walk, (2) 9 Hole Peg Test, and (3) Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test and gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)",
      "DetailedDescription": "STUDY TREATMENT:\n\nInvestigational therapy product: Wharton Jelly derived allogeneic MSCs.\n\nMethod of administration and dose: Super selective intravenous administration of 50 million Allogeneic Human Umbilical Cord Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSC) and intrathecal administration of UC-MSCs in dose of 100 million along with liberation therapy (when associated with CCSVI).\n\nSAFETY AND EFFICACY EVALUATION:\n\nThe proposed study will assess safety and primary and secondary efficacy endpoints after super selective intravenous and intrathecal administration of allogeneic umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) in 69 patients with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis.\n\nSafety Evaluation:\n\nAssessment of treatment safety based on incidence of any treatment emergent/treatment associated adverse events prior to discharge and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post treatment.\n\nEfficacy evaluation:\n\nClinical evaluations, including EDSS and 29-item Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) will be performed at baseline before stem cell mobilization, prior to discharge at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after stem cell therapy.\n\nThe MS Functional Composite (MSFC) consists of the (a) Timed 25-Foot Walk, (b) 9 Hole Peg Test, and (c) Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test will be performed at baseline before stem cell mobilization and at 12 months after stem cell therapy.\n\nGadolinium enhanced MRI scans of the brain will be performed at baseline before therapy and then 12 months after stem cell therapy. Follow-up scans will be performed on the same type of scanner used at baseline. Scans will be analyzed centrally. The 'baseline MRI scan' will be the reference for brain volume changes.\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:\n\nDescriptive analyses of the adverse events will be performed. Proportion of adverse events at each visit will be calculated using frequency distribution. The frequency, severity, timing and the potential relationship to the intervention will be assessed in order to characterize the safety of the intervention.\n\nThe probability of overall event-free survival (as well as progression-free, relapse-free, or MRI event-free survival) at baseline through 1 year will be calculated. The end point of progression is defined as increased Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score greater than 0.5 from baseline. Analyses will be conducted using Kaplan-Meier estimates with Wald-type 90% CIs based on Greenwood's formula for SE.\n\nDescriptive analyses of all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed using descriptive statistics. Proportion of patients with clinically significant change in this efficacy measurement scales (EDSS, MSIS, MSFC, MSFC-25 foot walking test, MSFC-Nine Hole Peg Test, MSFC-Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test) and change in gadolinium enhancing lesions, new T2 lesions from previous visit will be presented as a proportion.\n\nThe percentage of change in brain volume will be calculated from screening and analyzed by end point status at month 12 with an exact Wilcoxon rank sum test using mean scores when the results are identical.The null hypothesis tests whether the median percentage of change in brain volume among participants who met the endpoint by month 12 is equal to the median of those who have not met the end point by month 12.\n\nOther primary and secondary efficacy endpoints (EDSS, MSIS, MSFC, MSFC-25 foot walking test, MSFC-Nine Hole Peg Test, MSFC-Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test) will be analyzed using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Change from baseline outcomes for all the endpoints will be calculated for each patient who underwent stem cell transplant as the post transplant value minus the baseline value. The null hypothesis tests whether the median difference from baseline measurement in the values at the month 1, month 3, month 6 and month 12 visits was significantly different from zero,with baseline measurement defined as the screening assessment for the percentage of change in brain volume and the baseline visit for all other end points.\n\nTo calculate MSFC, results from each of the 3 components will be transformed into a z score and averaged to yield a composite for each patient at each timepoint. The z scores that compose the MSFC score will be calculated using the reference population from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society Task Force database."
