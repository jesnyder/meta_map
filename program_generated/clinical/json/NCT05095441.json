      "DetailedDescription": "This is a Phase 1 open label, first in human study of C5252 monotherapy designed to determine the safety and tolerability of a single IT injection of C5252 in patients with recurrent or progressive GBM. The Part 1 portion of the study is a 3+3 design to evaluate escalating doses of C5252. Total enrollment will depend on the toxicities and/or activity observed, with approximately 36 evaluable participants enrolled. Once the recommended dose (RD) is identified from Part 1, Part 2 Dose Expansion will enroll up to 15 additional participants to further assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of a single IT injection of C5252 monotherapy."
