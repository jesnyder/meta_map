      "BriefSummary": "Folliculogenesis involves the recruitment of primordial follicles into a group of growing follicles in which eventually one follicle is selected, matured and ovulated. Complex endocrine and intra-ovarian paracrine interactions occur to create a changing intra-follicular hormonal milieu suitable for oocyte development. However, this oocyte developmental competence and to undergo fertilization and embryogenesis is impaired in aged women. Diminished ovarian function is generally attributed to decreased quantity and quality of oocytes and their surrounding granulosa cells during ovarian aging, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.\n\nThe aim of the study is to investigate the miRNA in (follicular fluid) FF exosome in young and aged women and their relationship to egg maturation.",
      "DetailedDescription": "In recent decades, demographic and socioeconomic factors have resulted in marked changes in human society that include postponement of child bearing and a subsequent rise in mean age at first childbirth. Aged women have more reproductive problems (including menstrual irregulation and decreased ovarian reserve as reflected by reduced anti-mullerian hormone (AMH)) and their oocytes are often of lower quality when compared to younger women.\n\nFolliculogenesis involves the recruitment of primordial follicles into a group of growing follicles in which eventually one follicle is selected, matured and ovulated. Complex endocrine and intra-ovarian paracrine interactions occur to create a changing intra-follicular hormonal milieu suitable for oocyte development. However, this oocyte developmental competence, defined as the ability of the oocyte to complete follicular development, and to undergo fertilization and embryogenesis is impaired in aged women. Age-related decline in female fertility is mainly driven by ovarian aging, or diminished ovarian function associated with age. Diminished ovarian function is generally attributed to decreased quantity and quality of oocytes and their surrounding granulosa cells during ovarian aging, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Transcription studies have suggested indirectly that some age-related changes in oocyte gene expression and cell to cell communication may involve epigenetic machinery.\n\nOvarian follicle may be one of the best models in human for exosome study considering the role of the granulosa cells and follicular fluid for oocyte maturation. In the ovarian follicle, follicular fluid (FF) exosome may play an important mediated communication role between the oocyte and surrounding granulosa cells.\n\nThe aim of the study is to investigate the miRNA in (follicular fluid) FF exosome in young and aged women and their relationship to egg maturation."
