      "BriefSummary": "This study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Gingiva Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy for Chronic Adult Periodontitis.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Periodontitis featured by the progressive destruction loss of support tissues around the teeth has become a prevalent disease affecting the life quality of the adults. Although conventional periodontal treatment including open flap debridement and drug support therapy display reduced pocket depth and inflammation, the functional regeneration of the lost tissue and the repair of alveolar bone are insufficient. Gingiva mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs) are multipotent cells possess the capacity of multilineage differentiation and have become an attractive optional treatment method for the regeneration of periodontal tissues and function. Therefore, GMSCs will be selected as seed cells to treat periodontitis. This study will recruit 30 patients which will be divided into three groups. 10 patients in group A will receive GMSCs seeded into collagen scaffolds at the local periodontal defects immediately after open flap debridement. 10 patients in group B will only receive collagen scaffolds devoid of GMSCs after open flap debridement. 10 patients in group C will only undergo an open flap debridement. This study will test the safety and efficacy of GMSCs implantation in chronic adult periodontitis through alveolous bone reproduction and other clinical parameters."
