      "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to analyze the safety and efficacy of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation in patients with thoracolumbar chronic and complete spinal cord injury.",
      "DetailedDescription": "This is a randomized, non-placebo controlled, prospective, phase II clinical trial. The study population will consist of 40 patients who had spinal cord injury for at least 12 months, with thoracolumbar chronic and complete spinal cord injury, ASIA grade A.\n\nA practitioner, a surgeon and a nurse will review the medical records of the patients to determine the presence / absence of inclusion / exclusion criteria. If the patient is a potential candidate for the study, an interview will be scheduled to review and confirm his/her eligibility. Patients will undergo a series of clinical and neurological assessments and will also be submitted to the following procedures:\n\nCell blood count;\nBiochemical analysis (measurement of electrolytes - sodium, potassium, magnesium);\nRenal function tests (urea and creatinine);\nLiver function tests;\nCoagulation profile;\nMetabolic profile (glucose, total cholesterol and fractions);\nUrine summary and culture;\nSerology required for blood transfusion and marrow transplant in Brazil;\nElectrocardiogram;\nChest X-Ray;\nBone densitometry;\nUrodynamic studies;\nSomatosensory evoked potential;\nComputed tomography of thoracic and lumbar spine;\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic and lumbar spine.\n\nAlso as part of the preoperative evaluation, the patients will respond to questions from the SF (Short Form) -36 questionnaire (for assessment of quality of life) and the questionnaires for the assessment of neuropathic pain. Clinical follow-up will be kept for patients who suspend their participation in the study for any adverse event and / or laboratory abnormality, or for the patient's own desire, following insurance protocols. In addition to the clinical and surgical follow-up, specific medical care will be offered to patients who experience adverse events, until stabilization of the patient, even if the target date for completion of the study has been exceeded. The candidates included in the study will be asked to voluntarily participate and give their informed written consent."
