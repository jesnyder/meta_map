      "BriefSummary": "This is a phase 2b randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study with 2 treatment arms, to compare the efficacy and safety of AstroStem vs. Donepezil treatment in patients with mild Alzheimer's Disease(AD). Eligible patients diagnosed with AD within one year of the start of treatment will be enrolled. Patients who are randomized into the treatment group will be administered via intravenously AstroStem and Donepezil Placebo every 4 weeks from Week 0 to Week 16. On the other hand, patients who are randomized into the active control group will receive 5 mg of Donepezil and AstroStem Placebo every 4 weeks from Week 0 to Week 16. After the final administration, patients will be scheduled for two follow-up visits, at Weeks 28 and 40, to assess efficacy and safety endpoints."
