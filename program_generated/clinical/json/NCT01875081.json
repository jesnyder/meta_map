      "BriefSummary": "If the participant voluntarily agrees to participate in the clinical trial before registration, the investigator conducts a screening test to evaluate the participant's suitability.\n\nA participant that satisfies all selection and exclusion criteria is assigned randomly to a test group (1-time or 2-time injection group) or control group (no-cell therapy group). Participants assigned to the 1-time injection group conduct cell therapy within 1 month after bone marrow aspiration. Before implementing cell therapy, implement hepatic artery catheterization which inserts a catheter into the hepatic artery through the right aorta femoralis and inject 5X107 autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Participants assigned to the 2-time injection group store 1-time injection amount of mesenchymal stem cells while being cultivated after sampled from the bone marrow, and will re-inject autologous mesenchymal stem cells within 1 month after first injection.\n\nParticipants will make a total of 8 hospital visits on a 4-week interval after registration, and effectiveness and safety will be evaluated based on a fixed procedure on every visit."
