      "BriefSummary": "The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has granted approval for Rahika® (Capmatinib) film-coated tablet 150 and 200 mg for the treatment of adult patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have a mutation that leads to MET exon 14 skipping mutation with condition to perform a Phase IV clinical trial in Indian patients. As recommended by DCGI, this Phase IV study has been planned to evaluate the safety and efficacy of capmatinib in treatment of adult Indian patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have a MET exon 14 skipping mutation positive advanced NSCLC in any line of therapy.",
      "DetailedDescription": "This is a Phase IV, prospective, multicenter, open-label, interventional study. The study will include approximately 50 patients. The study will include molecular prescreening (28 days for patients who do not have documented MET exon 14 skipping mutation positive results), screening period (28 days), treatment period of 24 weeks, end of treatment (EOT) visit, and follow-up period of 30 days post last dose of study treatment. During the treatment period, study treatment will be administered as capmatinib 400 mg orally as twice daily (BID) on a continuous dosing schedule for 24 weeks. The treatment with capmatinib will be started only when the previous anti-cancer treatment was stopped within 4 weeks or ≥5 x half-life (whichever is longer) in subject who were on prior line/s of treatment. The treatment period begins on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Each treatment cycle will be of 21 days. Cycle 2 will start on Day 22 of the study and will be considered as Cycle 2 Day 22 (C2D22) and so on if there is no temporary discontinuation\n\nPatients may be discontinued from treatment earlier due to unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, withdrawal of consent, or at the discretion of the investigator or the patient. These patients will have end of study (EOS) assessment 30 days after the administration of last dose of the study treatment.\n\nEvery effort will be made by Novartis to continue provision of study treatment capmatinib via post trial access (PTA) to the patients who are ongoing on treatment at the end of the planned duration of study and deriving clinical benefit. Patients transitioning to PTA will also have to compete the EOS Visit assessment after the last dose administration of capmatinib for the current study."

Video-assisted thoracic surgery and mediastinoscopy will not be counted as major surgery and patients can be enrolled in the program ≥1 week after the procedure\n\nThoracic radiotherapy to lung fields ≤4 weeks prior to starting capmatinib or patients who have not recovered from radiotherapy-related toxicities.\n\nFor all other anatomic sites (including radiotherapy to thoracic vertebrae and ribs), radiotherapy ≤2 weeks prior to starting capmatinib or patients who have not recovered from radiotherapy-related toxicities. Palliative radiotherapy for bone lesions ≤2 weeks prior to starting capmatinib is allowed.\n\nImpairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of capmatinib or patients who are unable to swallow oral tablets.\nPatients receiving treatment with strong inducers of CYP3A that cannot be discontinued at least 1 week prior to the start of treatment with capmatinib and for the duration of the study\nUnable or unwilling to swallow tablets as per dosing schedule\nPatients with known hypersensitivity to capmatinib and any of the excipients of capmatinib.\nPatients with any other severe, acute or chronic medical or psychotic conditions or significant abnormal physical findings that in the opinion of the investigator may increase the risk associated with study participation or that may interfere with the interpretation of study results.\nPrevious (within 28 days) or concomitant participation in another clinical study with investigational medicinal product(s).\nPregnant or nursing (lactating) women.\n\nWomen of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception while taking study treatment and for 7 days after stopping study treatment. Highly effective contraception methods include:\n\nTotal abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Note that periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not considered highly effective and therefore not acceptable methods of contraception.\nFemale sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment.\nMale sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient\nUse of oral, (estrogen and progesterone), injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system, or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate <1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking treatment.\nSexually active males unwilling to use a condom during intercourse while taking study treatment and for 7 days after stopping study treatment. A condom is required for all sexually active male patients to prevent them from fathering a child AND to prevent delivery of study treatment via seminal fluid to their partner. In addition, male patients must not donate sperm for the time period specified above.\nAny other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance with clinical study procedures, e.g., active infection (including active hepatitis B and C, SARS-CoV-2), inflammation, intestinal obstruction, unable to swallow medication, social/ psychological issues, etc.",
