      "BriefSummary": "The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous dose of Human Umbilical Cord Tissue Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (hCT-MSC) in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). hCT-MSC is a cell product isolated from umbilical cord tissue. The cells from the cord tissue are processed and expanded in the laboratory and then infused intravenously in a single dose per participant. Participants will be ages 18-35 years, with ASD and a full-scale IQ >70 without an identified genetic cause of autism. Participants will have remote follow up visits at 3 and 12 months and an in-person visit at 6 months. In addition to the primary endpoints evaluating safety, the study will include secondary and exploratory endpoints evaluating Autism Spectrum Disorder specific outcome measures to describe any changes in autism symptoms after hCT-MSC administration.",
      "DetailedDescription": "This is a prospective, open label, phase one study to determine the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous dose of Human Umbilical Cord Tissue Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (hCT-MSC) in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). hCT-MSCs are manufactured from umbilical cord tissue donated by healthy mothers delivering full term babies via Cesarean Section. The cells are extracted from the cord tissue, expanded and cryopreserved (frozen). One dose of 2x10^6 cells/kg (maximum of 10 x 10^7) will be administered intravenously to each participant in this study.\n\nIt is hypothesized that immune dysregulation and/or abnormal neuronal connectivity that adversely affects normal brain development may cause core symptomatology observed in individuals with ASD. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have demonstrated a multitude of immunomodulatory effects which are thought to be carried out via paracrine and trophic signaling. While MSCs modulate the immune response, MSCs themselves have low immunogenicity (the body does not have a strong immune reaction against them) and they do not permanently engraft in the recipient.\n\nAdults ages 18 to 35 years with ASD will be eligible to participate. All participants will have a screening visit that includes clinical evaluation to verify the diagnosis of ASD, cognitive abilities, ASD symptom level, and confirmation of eligibility.\n\nOne dose of 2x10^6 cells/kg (maximum of 10 x 10^7) will be administered intravenously to each participant at a baseline visit. Participants will be admitted to the infusion center on the day of their baseline visit and vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate) will be measured. Participants may require some sedation prior to IV placement if they are unable to remain still or cooperate. A peripheral IV will be placed and prior to the infusion, premedications (Benadryl, Solumedrol, 0.5mg/kg each) will be administered. The hCT-MSCs product will be administered intravenously over 30-60 minutes. Pulse oximetry will be monitored continuously throughout the infusion and IV fluid maintenance will be given. Participants will be discharged after 1 hour, providing all vital signs are at their baseline and they are asymptomatic with no evidence of toxicity. Participants will be evaluated the day after the infusion to assess for any infusion-related adverse reactions or complications. A phone call or email to the participant or legally authorized representative to assess safety of the infusion will occur 7-10 days after the infusion. Remote follow up will occur 3 months and one year after infusion. Participants will return to Duke six months after infusion for repeated testing and safety follow-up. The Medical and Behavioral History Questionnaire assessing adverse events will be obtained at baseline, 3, 6 and 12-months.\n\nThe main endpoint is safety, for which acute infusion reactions, incidence of infections, and markers of alloimmunization will be assessed. Key secondary endpoints will include ASD-specific outcome measures to describe any changes in autism symptoms after product administration. Exploratory analyses will include measures obtained by EEG, eye-tracking, pupillary light reflex, computer vision analysis, and tactile stimulation."
