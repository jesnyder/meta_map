Participants matched with the inclusion criteria were allocated randomly into two groups:Human Umbilical Cord Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hUC-MSCs) treated group and control group. Clinical trials are being increasingly established to investigate the therapeutic potential of these cells for SLE. The aim of the present study is to investigate safety and efficacy of vein infusion of allogeneic hUC-MSCs in patients with SLE."
