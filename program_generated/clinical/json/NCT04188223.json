This Study is sequential age de-escalation. To be conducted in heathy adults (18-40 years old) and followed by children (10-17 years old) ). Before the study started, the subjects will be assessed for anti HBs Antibody. For subjects with anti-HBs not protective (< 10mIU/mL) before immunization, additional 2 doses will be required with 1 month interval."
