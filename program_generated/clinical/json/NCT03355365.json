      "BriefSummary": "This is a phase II, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over Study designed to determine the efficacy of multiple intrathecal administrations of autologous mesenchymal stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (MSC-NP) compared to placebo in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis. Efficacy will be measured through assessment of disability outcomes. Study participants will receive six intrathecal injections of culture-expanded autologous MSC-NPs at two month intervals in one year and six lumbar punctures as placebo treatments in a second year.",
      "DetailedDescription": "The IT-MSC-NP treatments and all clinical assessments will take place at a single center (Tisch MSRCNY). Study subjects will be assigned to blocks stratified by baseline EDSS score (3.0-4.0, 4.5-5.5, 6.0, and 6.5) and disease subtype (SPMS or PPMS). Study subjects are randomized in an equal fashion (1:1) to study treatment and placebo at initial randomization. Subjects in each block will be randomized into placebo or treatment group. In the second year, treated subjects will cross over to the placebo group and placebo subjects will cross over to the treated group.\n\nThe total study duration will be 3 years upon enrollment. Each study subject will be required to attend up to 18 study visits, to include 1 screening visit, 1 bone marrow visit, 1 baseline visit, followed by study visits every 2 months during the treatment period of two years (12 treatment/LP procedure visits and 2 outcome visits), and an additional follow-up visit at the end of year 3."
