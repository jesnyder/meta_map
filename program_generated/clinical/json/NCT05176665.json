      "DetailedDescription": "This is an open-label, Phase Ib/II, multi-stage study of EMB-01 in patients with advanced gastrointestinal tumors including gastric cancer, hepatocellular cancer, cholangiocarcinoma cancer and colorectal cancer, who have EGFR/cMET gene alterations or protein over expression and progressed on available standard therapies and for whom no standard therapy exists that would confer clinical benefit. All patients will be prescreened for cMET and EGFR genetic alterations and protein expression. Only those who met the molecular pre-screening criteria will proceed to clinical screening to determine the eligibility. The study will consist of Phase Ib part and Phase II part, both phases will consist of a molecular prescreening period, screening period, treatment period, safety follow-up period, and disease progression follow-up."
