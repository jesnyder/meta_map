      "BriefSummary": "To assess whether intravenously administered third-party bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are safe and have an impact on disease severity in RDEB",
      "DetailedDescription": "This is a phase I/II clinical trial with a key objective of evaluating safety of third party bone MSCs intravenous infusions in 10 adults with the inherited severe skin fragility disorder, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). The main objectives of our study are to: (1) to assess the spectrum of clinical responses in adults with RDEB receiving intravenous MSCs; (2) to identify the best cohort of individuals to target for future trials and therapies; (3) to improve our understanding of in vivo and in vitro responsiveness to MSCs; (4) to identify candidate molecules germane to activating MSCs and making them clinically more potent, independently of the permissive conditions of the patient and (5) to assess its impact on reducing disease morbidity/severity in this population.\n\nThis is a prospective, non-randomised, open label study. All study participants will receive two intravenous MSC infusions at baseline Day 0 and Day 14 and will be followed up for a 12 month period following the first infusion. Each subject will undergo an initial screening including physical examination, assessment of vital signs and disease severity assessment."
