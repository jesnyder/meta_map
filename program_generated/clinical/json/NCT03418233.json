There are several secondary questions, defined by secondary endpoints in each cohort, e.g.: if the investigated treatment is possible to administered, if the investigated treatment and way of CardioCell administration is safe, if it is possible to define any selected subgroup in which the treatment results are significantly different than in whole group."
