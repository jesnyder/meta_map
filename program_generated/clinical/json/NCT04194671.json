Effect of routine therapy is limited and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)are considered a new therapy for treating severe acute kidney injury. Patients will be randomized to receive intravenous infusion of MSC, or placebo control. This trial is to investigate whether MSC can improve renal recovery and mortality of patients with AKI."
