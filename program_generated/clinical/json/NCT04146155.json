      "BriefSummary": "Diabetic lower extremity arterial disease ( DLEAD ), is a common complication of type 2 diabetes. However, DLEAD remains less studied than other diabetic vascular complications; and only few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have dealt with major lower-limb adverse events as prespecified endpoints. Studies have suggested that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues have a protective effect on the development of atherosclerosis, potentially mediated via the GLP-1 receptors expressed on endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and in monocytes/macrophages. The investigators aim to evaluate the improvement of lower extremity ischemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated with lower limb vascular lesions after liraglutide, compared with the standard-of-care treatment group.",
      "DetailedDescription": "GLP-1 is an incretin hormone that mediates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.Accumulating data from both animal and human studies confirmed a beneficial effect of GLP-1 on myocardium, endothelium and vasculature, suggesting the potential ameliorative effect of peripheral atherosclerosis. In our preliminary studies shown that liraglutide, a long-acting GLP-1R agonist (GLP1RA), stimulate endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis. The study aims to test the hypothesis that sustained activation of the GLP-1R enhances microvascular perfusion, promotes angiogenesis, leading to increased walking distance and limb perfusion in diabetes patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to with or without liraglutide treatment by a 6-month follow-up. The primary endpoints are the change in initial and absolute claudication distance and assessment of limb ischemia at 6 months compared with baseline. This trial will collect important mechanistic and clinical information on the safety and efficacy of liraglutide in T2DM patients with PAD."
