      "DetailedDescription": "The study population will include patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 and laboratory markers predictive of the cytokine storm, who have provided an informed consent.\n\n90 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 109 exosome particles (45 patients) or 1010 exosome particles (45 patients).\n\nThe exosomes will be diluted in normal saline for inhalation via mouthpiece nebulization, administered once daily (QD) for 5 days.\n\nStudy treatments will be given as an add-on to the standard of care. Following the 5 days of treatment, patients will remain in follow-up for 23 additional days. In case of hospital discharge before the full follow-up planned, the patient will be required to return to the site for completion of all study assessments."
