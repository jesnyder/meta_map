      "BriefSummary": "This is a Phase I study with the primary objective of identifying the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of FT516 using 3 dose-escalation strategies (number of doses and cell dose) for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study provides initial estimates of safety and efficacy based on stable respiratory function, as well as, determining the feasibility for full-scale studies designed both for efficacy and safety.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Given the urgency of COVID-19 and the known anti-viral activity of natural killer (NK) cells, this clinical trial uses immediately available off-the-shelf induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived NK cells already being used to treat cancer patients.\n\nFT516 is an off-the-shelf cryopreserved NK cell product derived from an iPSC that was transduced with a high affinity, ADAM17 non-cleavable CD16 (Fc receptor) that maintains CD16 on the cell surface, which remains fully functional after NK cell activation. The investigators expect that natural developing anti-COVID IgG (early data suggest that some develop in 7-10 days after diagnosis) will enhance targeting of FT516 to infected cells."
