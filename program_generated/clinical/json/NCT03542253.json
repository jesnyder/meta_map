Twenty-two patients underwent surgical treatment and 14 tissue specimens were examined for cancer and paracancerous tissue exosomesWe found that exosomal micor-A was highly expressed in early stage lung cancer tissues and was significantly higher than paracancerous tissues. The micor-A in the adjacent tissues was significantly higher than that in peripheral blood exosomes"
