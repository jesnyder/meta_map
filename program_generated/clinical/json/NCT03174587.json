      "DetailedDescription": "Lupus is a representative autoimmune disease that affects the whole body. It is occurred by generation of autoantibody and immune complex due to abnormal activation of the immune cells on the basis of abnormal immune responses.\n\nAlthough about 50% of lupus patients have lupus nephritis, there is no therapy product targeted for the lupus nephritis now.\n\nWe have performed the pre-clinical and clinical studies using allogenic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells in SLE.\n\nCS20AT04 has anti-inflammatory effects, controls activity of immune cells and reduces generation of autoantibodies. So, it is expected to have treatment effects of lupus nephritis.\n\nThe clinical trial was designed as a single center, open-label, phase 1 clinical trials.\n\nIf that subject's written informed consent form to participate in this clinical trial will be conducted the required examinations and tests in accordance with the study protocol within 56 days investigational drug administration.\n\nThen, the register for each dose step. For the final 3 subjects in the inclusion / exclusion criteria and be administered a drug test.\n\nCheck the adverse events for more than four hours after administration of the investigational drug, and will determine whether the expression of adverse drug reaction(ADR) by the visit after 3 days, 7 days and 28 days.\n\nExcept for dose administration, all subject are tested in the same schedule. As a result of evaluating severity of AE divided into grades in accordance with the CTCAE (Version 4.0) standards."
