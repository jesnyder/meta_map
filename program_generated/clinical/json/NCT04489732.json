      "BriefSummary": "This is a single center pilot study designed to determine the safety and tolerability of autologous bone marrow-derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) in patients with xerostomia (dry mouth) after undergoing radiation therapy (XRT) for head and neck cancer (HNC). Up to 12 participants will be enrolled and can expect to be on study for up to 2 years.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Following the completion of screening/baseline procedures, and written consent, eligible participants will undergo bone marrow aspirate in order to obtain MSCs.\n\nThe MSC Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) (dose level 0, n=6, staggered) will be injected into one submandibular gland under local anesthesia, in the gland that received the lowest radiation dose. Patients with only one submandibular gland will be ineligible.\n\nAll participants will be called by a study coordinator 3 days (+/- 2 days) after injection to assess pain and will have a phone visit with a physician 1 week (+/- 2 days) after injection during which the investigator will assess pain and ask about the area of injection regarding redness and/or swelling. All participants will complete a pain diary with daily entries over the first month to record the occurrence and severity of pain using a 0-10 visual analog scale and occurrence and severity of other adverse events (e.g., redness, swelling, warmth, tenderness, rash, pruritis, nausea, vomiting, fatigue). Participants will also keep a log of all pain medications taken including both narcotic and non-narcotic medications (e.g. ibuprofen, acetaminophen, etc.) for the first month. Participants will complete 5 follow-up visits over the course of 24 months - at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months following the intervention. Salivary collection for analysis as well as QoL surveys will be obtained at these visits.\n\nDose Reduction:\n\nIf dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in less than or equal to 1 participant (n=6 participants, staggered at least 14 days), Dose Level 0 will be recommended as starting dose for subsequent trial.\nIf DLT in greater than 1 participant, dose level -1 will be administered, staggered at least 14 days in n=6 participants.\nIf DLT in this cohort is in less than or equal to 1 participant, Dose Level -1 will be recommended as starting dose for subsequent trial. If DLT in greater than or equal to 2 participants, study will be stopped.\n\nPrimary Objective\n\nTo evaluate the safety and tolerability of MSCs for subjects with xerostomia after radiation therapy for HNC.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy of MSCs for treatment of xerostomia and salivary hypofunction via quality-of-life (QoL) questionnaires, salivary amount, and salivary compositional analysis.\nTo assess the imaging characteristics in HNC patients after MSC injection using ultrasound.\nTo assess the feasibility of a future Phase 1 dose-escalation study."
