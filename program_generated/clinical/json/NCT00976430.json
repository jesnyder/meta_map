      "BriefSummary": "This study is intended to look at the safety and efficacy of the use of autologous bone marrow derived stem cell transplant in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, still at its best can only be controlled by medical or surgical treatment. For more than two decades various groups have tried using modified cell transplants for curing this disease. Earlier results with use of fetal mesencephalic cell transplant were encouraging, but this had to be discontinued due to severe side effects.\n\nCurrent interest, in the use of Mesenchymal stem cells as a pluripotent cell for developing neural cells has been the background for this study. Reliance Life sciences had found encouraging results with the use of human MSCs in Rat model of PD. Based on this and other data, Jaslok Hospital and Research Centre has initiated a pilot study to investigate the efficacy of Autologous MSCs in treating advanced PD. This cells will be harvested from bone marrow, processed at RLS laboratory and transplanted by stereotactic techniques into the striatum of the patient."
