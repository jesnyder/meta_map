After the week 12 visit, or ulcer closure, whichever occurs first, each patient will return to the clinic 1 (± 2 days), 2 (± 2 days), 4 (± 3 days), 8 (±3 days), and 12 (±3days) weeks later for follow-up visits to for adverse events, assess wound, wound closure and durability.\n\n1.10 Primary Outcome\n\nSerious adverse events that are attributable to intervention.\n\n1.11 Secondary Outcomes\n\nTime to complete wound closure (defined as from treatment day 1 to the first visit when closure is documented). Absolute and percent changes in wound area from baseline, at weekly intervals throughout. Durability of wound closure as measured at 4 week intervals for 12 weeks from date of wound closure."
