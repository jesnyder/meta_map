Note that auto-immmunity is defined as a systemic immune mediated disease for which the antigen is known or unknown. Autoimmune diseases other than UC are excluded. Extraintestinal manifestations of UC (specifically joint inflammation, eye inflammation, PSC, skin manifestations- i.e. pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum) will be allowable.\nAllergic to local anesthetics\nPregnant patients or trying to become pregnant or breast feeding.\nNeoplasia of the colon and preoperative biopsy\nC.
