      "BriefSummary": "The current multicentre phase III study is proposed to confirm in an add-on therapy design compared to a placebo-control group, the efficacy of adipose-derived stem cells (eASCs) from healthy donors for the treatment of complex anal fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease over a 24-week period and an extended follow-up period up to 104 weeks.",
      "DetailedDescription": "The current multicentre phase III study is proposed to confirm in an add-on therapy design compared to a placebo-control group, the efficacy of adipose-derived stem cells (eASCs) from healthy donors for the treatment of complex anal fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease over a 24-week period and an extended follow-up period up to 104 weeks. Subject with perianal fistulising Crohn's disease will be treated with Cx601, suspension of eASCs, at a dose of 120 million cells administered by intralesional injection. The treatment of complex perianal fistulas by local application of eASCs intends to improve significantly the local conditions with very few inconveniences (ambulatory procedure) and minimal risk of possible complications (anal incontinence). Therefore, this is a new therapeutic resource that is expected to be safe and efficacious as well as is expected to improve the quality of life of the patients in this highly debilitating and chronic condition. This treatment would prevent one of the main causes of anal incontinence, would diminish recurrence of the fistula disease and would reduce drastically the significant disorders provoked by the standard fistula surgery in the patients. Indeed, patients can be discharged according to the \"One Day Surgical\" procedures (major ambulatory surgery)."
