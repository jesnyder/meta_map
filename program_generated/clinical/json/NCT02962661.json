To demonstrate the safety of allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) administered by intravenous infusion and transendocardial injection in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and heart failure secondary to chemotherapy with anthracyclines.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To demonstrate the efficacy of allogeneic hMSCs administered by intravenous infusion and transendocardial injection in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] < 40%) and heart failure secondary to treatment with anthracyclines.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive hMSCs intravenously (IV) over 10-20 minutes on days 1, 14, 21, and 28 and standard of care treatment for heart failure in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients receive hMSCs transendocardially for a total of 15 injections and standard of care treatment for heart failure in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM III: Patients receive standard of care treatment for heart failure.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically."
