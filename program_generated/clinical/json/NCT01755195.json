      "BriefSummary": "Background:\n\n- Cabozantinib is a cancer treatment drug that blocks the growth of new blood vessels in tumors. It can also block a chemical on tumor cells that allows the cells to grow. A similar drug, pazopanib, is used to treat types of cancer known as sarcomas. Researchers want to see if cabozantinib can be an effective treatment for types of soft tissue sarcoma that have not responded to earlier treatments.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- To test the effectiveness of cabozantinib for soft tissue sarcomas that have not responded to standard treatments.\n\nEligibility:\n\n- Individuals at least 18 years of age who have soft tissue sarcomas that have not responded to standard treatments.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples will be collected. Imaging studies and other tests will be used to study the tumor before the start of treatment.\nParticipants will take cabozantinib tablets daily for 28-day cycles of treatment. The tablets should be taken whole on an empty stomach.\nTreatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.\nParticipants will continue to take cabozantinib for as long as the tumor does not become worse and the side effects are not too severe.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Background:\n\nSoft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a relatively rare heterogeneous group of tumors that constitute about 1% of adult cancers.\nThe mainstay of treatment for advanced disease has been palliative chemotherapy with a median overall survival of approximately 12 months. This has not changed considerably in the past years and there is an unmet need for newer targeted therapies.\nVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels are elevated in patients with STS and various sarcoma cell lines express high levels of activated c-Met receptor.\nWe hypothesize that dual targeting of the VEGF and mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET) pathways with cabozantinib would result in clinical benefit in patients with soft tissue sarcoma.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary:\n\nAssess the response rate (Complete Response (CR)+Partial Response (PR) of cabozantinib in patients with soft tissue sarcomas.\nAssess the 6 month progression free survival (PFS) of cabozantinib in soft tissue sarcomas.\n\nSecondary:\n\n-Determine and compare circulating levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), soluble MET (sMET), VEGF-A, and soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) (sVEGFR2) prior to and following administration of cabozantinib.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPatients must have had disease progression following one line of standard therapy\nAge greater than or equal to 18 years.\nAdequate organ function.\n\nDesign:\n\nAll patients will receive cabozantinib at 60 mg by mouth (PO) daily in 4 week cycles.\nTumor response evaluations by imaging will be done every 2 cycles (less frequently for patients on study more than one year).\nThe study will be conducted as a dual-endpoint two-stage Phase II trial to target objective tumor response rate (CR+PR) of 30% against an unacceptably low rate of 10%, and 6-month PFS rate of 65% against an unacceptably low rate of 45% (corresponding to median PFS of 9.6 vs. 5.2 months).\nThe trial will accrue up to 55 patients."

Tablets must not be crushed or chewed.\nThe effects of cabozantinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because receptor tyrosine kinases are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception. All subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use both a barrier method and a second method of birth control during the course of the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s).\n\nSexually active subjects (men and women) must agree to use medically accepted barrier methods of contraception (e.g., male or female condom) during the course of the study and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s), even if oral contraceptives are also used.\n\n-Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nPatients who have had anticancer therapy, including kinase inhibitors or any investigational agent within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter) (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered to baseline from adverse events (except alopecia and other non-clinically significant adverse events (AEs). Patients who have received prior cabozantinib or inhibitors of tyrosine-protein kinase mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (c-MET) or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) are ineligible.\nThe subject has received radionuclide treatment within 6 weeks of the first dose of study treatment\nThe subject has received radiation therapy within 4 weeks (greater than or equal to 2 weeks for palliative radiation therapy)\nPatients with active brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis or epidural disease are excluded from this clinical trial. Subjects with brain metastases previously treated with whole brain radiation or radiosurgery or subjects with epidural disease previously treated with radiation who are asymptomatic and have remained stable for 4 weeks and do not require steroid treatment for at least 2 weeks before starting study treatment are eligible. Neurosurgical resection of brain metastases or brain biopsy is permitted if completed at least 3 months before starting study treatment. Baseline brain imaging with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scans for subjects with known brain metastases is required to confirm eligibility.\nEligibility of subjects receiving any medications or substances known to affect or with the potential to affect the activity of cabozantinib will be determined following review of their cases by the Principal Investigator. Patients who are taking enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant agents are not eligible.\nPatients with refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that could interfere with absorption.\nUncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\nPregnant women are excluded from this study because cabozantinib has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with cabozantinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with cabozantinib.\nStrong inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) can affect levels of cabozantinib and should be avoided whenever possible or switched to alternatives. Subjects requiring chronic concomitant treatment of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, and St. John's Wort) are not eligible for this study. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/; medical reference texts such as the Physicians Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over the-counter medicine or herbal product.\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with cabozantinib. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.\nThe subject requires concomitant treatment, in therapeutic doses, with anticoagulants such as warfarin or warfarin-related agents, heparin, thrombin or Factor Xa inhibitors, or antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel). Low dose aspirin (less than or equal to 81 mg/day), low-dose warfarin (less than or equal to 1 mg/day), and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are permitted. (Please note that there may be cases in which patients on study require anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE) management; this does not necessitate taking\n\nthe patient off study.)\n\nThe subject has experienced any of the following\n\nclinically-significant gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 months before the first dose of study treatment\nhemoptysis of greater than or equal to 0.5 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of red blood within 3 months before the first dose of study treatment\nany other signs indicative of pulmonary hemorrhage within 3 months before the first dose of study treatment\nThe subject has radiographic evidence of cavitating pulmonary lesion(s).\nThe subject has tumor in contact with, invading, or encasing any major blood vessels\nThe subject has evidence of tumor invading the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (esophagus, stomach, small or large bowel, rectum or anus), or any evidence of endotracheal or endobronchial tumor within 28 days before the first dose of cabozantinib\n\nThe subject has uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness including, but not limited to, the following conditions:\n\nCardiovascular disorders including:\n\nCongestive heart failure (CHF): New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III (moderate) or Class IV (severe) at the time of screening\nConcurrent uncontrolled hypertension defined as sustained BP > 140 mm Hg systolic, or > 90 mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive treatment within 7 days of the first dose of study treatment\nAny history of congenital long QT syndrome\n\nAny of the following within 6 months before the first dose of study treatment:\n\nunstable angina pectoris\nclinically-significant cardiac arrhythmias\nstroke (including transient ischemic attack (TIA), or other ischemic event)\nmyocardial infarction\nthromboembolic event requiring therapeutic anticoagulation (Note: subjects with a venous filter (e.g. vena cava filter) are not eligible for this study)\n\nGastrointestinal disorders particularly those associated with a high risk of perforation or fistula formation including:\n\nAny of the following within 28 days before the first dose of study treatment\n\nintra-abdominal tumor/metastases invading GI mucosa\nactive peptic ulcer disease,\ninflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), diverticulitis, cholecystitis, symptomatic cholangitis or appendicitis\nmalabsorption syndrome\n\nAny of the following within 6 months before the first dose of study treatment:\n\nabdominal fistula\ngastrointestinal perforation\nbowel obstruction or gastric outlet obstruction\nintra-abdominal abscess. Note: Complete resolution of an intra-abdominal abscess must be confirmed prior to initiating treatment with cabozantinib even if the abscess occurred more that 6 months before the first dose of study treatment.\nOther disorders associated with a high risk of fistula formation including percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement within 3 months before the first dose of study therapy\n\nOther clinically significant disorders such as:\n\nserious non-healing wound/ulcer/bone fracture within 28 days before the first dose of study treatment\nhistory of organ transplant, including allogeneic bone marrow transplant\nconcurrent uncompensated hypothyroidism or thyroid dysfunction within 7 days before the first dose of study treatment\nhistory of major surgery as follows:\n\ni.
