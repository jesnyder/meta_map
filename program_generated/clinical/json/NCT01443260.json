      "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether GL-ONC1, an attenuated vaccinia virus, is safe when administered to patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis via an infusion within the abdominal cavity through an implanted catheter. The study seeks also to arrive at a recommended dose and schedule for future investigations, evidence of anti-tumor activity, detection of virus in body fluids, analysis of viral delivery to tumor and normal cells, and to evaluate if there is an antibody response to vaccinia virus.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Peritoneal carcinomatosis includes a variety of tumors with extensive metastasis throughout the peritoneal cavity (inside surface of the abdomen) and can be found with gall bladder, liver, colon, appendix, ovarian, pancreas, mesothelioma, pseudomyxoma peritonei, rectal, small bowel and stomach cancers. It broadly includes multiple tumors that develop in and line the peritoneal abdominal cavity and linings. These tumors may be difficult to completely remove surgically and may recur despite conventional systemic chemotherapy, thereby resulting in poor patient outcomes. In preclinical studies, GL-ONC1, an oncolytic vaccinia virus, has shown the ability to preferentially locate, colonize and destroy tumor cells in more than 30 different human tumors. A Phase I clinical study focusing on the safety and tolerability of GL-ONC1 intravenously administered to patients with a variety of solid tumor entities has shown that GL-ONC1 is well-tolerated at therapeutic dose levels, with documented evidence of antitumor activity. This additional Phase I/II study seeks to evaluate GL-ONC1 administered repetitively every 4 weeks up to 4 cycles via infusion using an implanted catheter in the peritoneal cavity. In Phase I, patients will be individually assessed for safety and dose limiting toxicity. The study aims of Phase II portion are continued collection of safety information to better define the tolerability of GL-ONC1, as well as viral replication and the action or effect of GL-ONC1 in humans at the selected dose level and dosing schedule for future trials. Throughout both phases of the study, anti-tumor effects will be evaluated."
