      "BriefSummary": "This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of exosome deployment with concurrent transcranial ultrasound in patients with refractory, treatment resistant depression, anxiety, and neurodegenerative dementia.",
      "DetailedDescription": "The present study is designed to enhance the delivery of growth factors and anti-inflammatory agents to localized targets (determined by specific condition) by using focused transcranial ultrasound prior to intravenous infusion of exosomes. Exosomes, which are ubiquitous in blood, body fluids, and tissues are thought to play a normal physiological role in intercellular signaling. Exosomes delivered intravenously can be demonstrated to cross the blood brain barrier naturally. Exosomes and mesenchymal signaling cells (MSC's) demonstrate anti-inflammatory and pro-growth effects in preclinical models and clinical cases reports and have been used intravenously and with intracerebral and intrathecal injection. Various clinical trials have claimed safety and clinical efficacy.\n\nFocused ultrasound has been demonstrated to enhance local blood flow and has been proposed as a non-invasive means of targeting delivery of therapeutic agents. The present paper was designed to use focused ultrasound as a means of enhancing delivery of intravenous exosomes to the subgenual target for patients with refractory depression, the amygdala for patients with anxiety, and the hippocampus for patients with cognitive impairment due to neurodegenerative disease."
