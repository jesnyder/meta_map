      "BriefSummary": "Background:\n\nThe new drug LMP744 damages DNA. This causes cell death. Researchers want to see if it can treat certain kinds of cancer. They want to understand how the drug works and how it affects the body.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test the safety of LMP744 and find out the dose of the drug that can be safely given to humans.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults at least 18 years old who have metastatic solid tumors or lymphoma, which have progressed after other treatment.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\nVital signs taken\nBlood and urine tests\nHeart tests\nScans or ultrasound\n\nSome participants will have a tumor sample taken 2 times. A small piece of tumor is removed by a small needle. A scan or ultrasound will guide the process.\n\nThe study will be done in 28-day cycles.\n\nEach cycle, participants will get the study drug in a vein for 60 minutes once a day for 5 days.\n\nFor day 1 of cycle 1, participants will be admitted to the clinic and have blood and urine taken several times.\n\nAt the beginning of each cycle, participants will have a clinic visit and repeat some screening tests. They will also do this twice in the middle of cycle 1 and once in the middle of cycle 2.\n\nAfter participants stop taking the study drug, they will be followed for 30 days. They may give blood samples. They will be contacted by phone to see how they are doing.",
      "DetailedDescription": "Background:\n\nIndenoisoquinolines are non-camptothecin inhibitors of topoisomerase 1 (top1) with improved characteristics over their predecessors. Indenoisoquinolines have better chemical stability, producing stable DNA-top1 cleavage complexes, and exhibit a preference for unique DNA cleavage sites, compared with their camptothecin counterparts.\nThey have demonstrated activity against camptothecin-resistant cell lines and produce DNA-protein crosslinks, which are resistant to reversal. They also show less or no resistance to cells overexpressing the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ABCG2, and multidrug resistance (MDR-1).\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\n-To establish the safety, tolerability and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LMP744 (NSC 706744) administered intravenously (IV) daily for 5 days (QD x 5) schedule in patients with refractory solid tumors and lymphomas.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n-Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of LMP744.\n\nExploratory Objectives:\n\nEvaluate the effect of LMP744 on markers of DNA damage (yH2AX, pNbs1, pATR, ERCC1, RAD51, Topo1cc, Top1, SLFN11) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and pre- and post- treatment tumor biopsies in patients at the expansion cohort.\nAssess preliminary antitumor activity of LMP744.\n\nEligibility:\n\n-Adult patients must have histologically documented, relapsed solid tumors which have progressed after one line of therapy, or lymphoma which has progressed after initial therapy and without potentially curative options, or patient refuses potentially curative therapy.\n\nStudy Design:\n\nCycle 1 and subsequent cycles: Patients will receive LMP744 administered IV QD over 1 hour on days 1-5 followed by 23 days without drug (28-day cycle).\nPK and PD samples will be collected. Tumor biopsies will be mandatory during the expansion phase."

            "InterventionDescription": "Indenoisoquinolines, such as LMP744, are potent inhibitors of the enzyme topoisomerase I (Top1). Top1 is necessary for transcription, replication, recombination, and the repair of double-strand DNA breaks. It relaxes the supercoiled DNA by introducing a single-strand break, generating a free strand that rotates around the Top1-bound DNA complex. In the absence of external triggers, Top1-DNA cleavage complexes are generally short lived. Top1 inhibitors are potent anticancer agents because they stabilize the formation of the Top1-DNA cleavage complex in tumor cells, which induces DNA damage, delays DNA repair, and results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. LMP744 exhibited antitumor activity with lower toxicity than other agents in preclinical studies. Treatment of patients with LMP744 is expected to reduce tumor burden at doses that are well-tolerated.",

Patients receiving treatment with warfarin will be given the option to switch to LMWH or a\n\nDOAC.\n\nPatients must have recovered to grade 1 or baseline from adverse events (AEs) and/or toxicity of prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy. They must not have had chemotherapy, biologic therapy, or definitive radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin C) or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to entering the study. Palliative-intent radiotherapy (30 Gy or less) must be completed at least 2 weeks prior to start of treatment, and may not be to a lesion that is included as measurable disease. Patients must be greater than or equal to 2 weeks since any investigational agent administered as part of a Phase 0 study (where a sub-therapeutic dose of drug is administered) at the PI s discretion, and should have recovered to grade 1 or baseline from any toxicities.\nPatients receiving denosumab or bisphosphonates for any cancer or undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer are eligible for this therapy.\nPrior therapy with topoisomerase I inhibitors is allowed.\nHIV-positive patients are eligible provided the following criteria are met: CD4 count >350/mm3, an undetectable viral load, and not receiving prophylaxis antibiotics.\nThe effects of LMP744 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Women and men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of LMP744 administration.\nAbility to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\nWillingness to provide blood and new tumor biopsy samples for research purposes if on the expansion phase of the study.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nPatients who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n\nPatients with clinically significant illnesses which would compromise participation in the study, including, but not limited to active or uncontrolled infection, immune deficiencies, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or\n\npsychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n\nPatients with known brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded from this clinical trial, with the exception of patients whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for greater than or equal to 1 month after treatment of the brain metastases. Patients on anti-seizure medications or steroid therapy may be enrolled at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.\nPregnant women are excluded from this study because LMP744 is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with LMP744, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated.\n\nINCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES:\n\nBoth men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.",
